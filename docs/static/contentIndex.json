This channel works independently of the operating system (OS), rendering any communication over it invisible to firewall and network monitoring applications running on the host device. Until this incident, no malware had been discovered misusing the AMT SOL feature for communication.\nUpon discovery of this unique file-transfer tool, Microsoft shared information with Intel, and the two companies collaborated to analyze and better understand the purpose and implementation of the tool. We confirmed that the tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself, but rather misused AMT SOL within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameAMTsolAdupihan\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nwww.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/07/platinum-continues-to-evolve-find-ways-to-maintain-invisibility/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.amtsol\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n454c7a03-4419-43d9-9671-5c70a4a81a8d\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-28"},"APEC-and-OSCE":{"slug":"APEC-and-OSCE","filePath":"APEC and OSCE.md","title":"APEC and OSCE","links":["APEC-and-OSCE"],"tags":[],"content":"APEC and OSCE\nA page for the country APEC and OSCE."},"APERETIF":{"slug":"APERETIF","filePath":"APERETIF.md","title":"APERETIF","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"APERETIF\nDescription\n(SentinelLabs) APERETIF is a trojan, automating the collection of victim details, maintaining access, and beaconing outbound the actor-controlled domain.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameAPERETIF\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nReconnaissance\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nwww.sentinelone.com/labs/winter-vivern-uncovering-a-wave-of-global-espionage/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.aperetif\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ne30e2b07-c32a-4523-a7fa-ef83bec4d4c1\nLast Card Change\n2023-06-22"},"APT-12,-Numbered-Panda":{"slug":"APT-12,-Numbered-Panda","filePath":"APT 12, Numbered Panda.md","title":"APT 12, Numbered Panda","links":["China","Defense","Government","High-Tech","Media","Telecommunications","Electronics-and-journalists","Germany","Japan","Taiwan","USA","East-Asia","AUMLIB","ETUMBOT","IHEATE","IXESHE","RapidStealer","THREEBYTE","WaterSpout"],"tags":[],"content":"APT 12, Numbered Panda\nDescription\n(CrowdStrike) Numbered Panda has a long list of high-profile victims and is known by a number of names including: DYNCALC, IXESHE, JOY RAT, APT-12, etc.  Numbered Panda has targeted a variety of victims including but not limited to media outlets, high-tech companies, and multiple governments. Numbered Panda has targeted organizations in time-sensitive operations such as the Fukushima Reactor Incident of 2011, likely filling intelligence gaps in the ground cleanup/mitigation operations.  Screen saver files, which are binary executables and PDF documents, are common Numbered Panda weaponization tactics.  One of the most interesting techniques that Numbered Panda likes to use is to dynamically calculate the Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS.  This effectively helps Numbered Panda bypass egress filtering implemented to prevent unauthorized communications on some enterprises.  The malware will typically use two DNS names for communication: one is used for command and control; the other is used with an algorithm to calculate the port to communicate to.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAPT 12MandiantNumbered PandaCrowdStrikeCTG-8223SecureWorksBronze GlobeSecureWorksBeeBusFireEyeCalc TeamSymantecDynCALCSymantecDNSCalcSymantecGroup 22TalosCrimson IronThreatConnectHexagon TyphoonMicrosoft\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2009\nObserved Sectors\n\nDefense\nGovernment\nHigh-Tech\nMedia\nTelecommunications\nElectronics and journalists\n\nObserved Countries\n\nGermany\nJapan\nTaiwan\nUSA\nEast Asia\n\nTools\n\nAUMLIB\nETUMBOT\nIHEATE\nIXESHE\nRapidStealer\nTHREEBYTE\nWaterSpout\n\nOperations\n\n2009-07: “IXESHE” campaign\nTarget: East Asian governments, Taiwanese electronics manufacturers and a telecommunications company.\nwww.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_ixeshe.pdf\n2011-05: “AUMLIB” campaign\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/survival-of-the-fittest-new-york-times-attackers-evolve-quickly.html\n2011: “ETUMBOT” campaign\nTarget: Taiwan\nOnce the malicious file was downloaded and extracted by the victim, Etumbot uses a right-to-left override exploit to trick the victim to download the malware installer.

Symantec has monitored this group’s activities for the last three years as they have consistently targeted a number of industries. Interesting highlights in their method of operations include: the use of seemingly an unlimited number of zero-day exploits, attacks on supply chain manufacturers who service the target organization, and a shift to “watering hole” attacks (compromising certain websites likely to be visited by the target organization). The targeted industry sectors include, but are not restricted to; defense, various defense supply chain manufacturers, human rights and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and IT service providers. These attackers are systematic and re-use components of an infrastructure we have termed the “Elderwood platform”. The name “Elderwood” comes from a source code variable used by the attackers. This attack platform enables them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits. Attacks are deployed through spear phishing emails and also, increasingly, through Web injections in watering hole attacks.\nIt is likely the attackers have gained access to the source code for some widely used applications, or have thoroughly reverse-engineered the compiled applications in order to discover these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are used as needed, often within close succession of each other if exposure of any of the vulnerabilities is imminent. The scale of the attacks, in terms of the number of victims and the duration of the attacks, are another indication of the resources available to the attackers. Victims are attacked, not for petty crime or theft, but for the wholesale gathering of intelligence and intellectual property. The resources required to identify and acquire useful information—let alone analyze that information—could only be provided by a large criminal organization, attackers supported by a nation state, or a nation state itself.\nThis group appears to be closely associated with Hidden Lynx, Aurora Panda and has infrastructure overlap with RedAlpha.\nCould also be related to Axiom, Group 72.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAPT 17MandiantTailgater TeamSymantecElderwoodSymantecElderwood GangSymantecSneaky PandaCrowdStrikeSIG22NSABeijing GroupSecureWorksBronze KeystoneSecureWorksTG-8153SecureWorksTEMP.AvengersFireEyeDogfishiDefenseDeputy DogiDefenseATK 2Thales\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored, Jinan bureau of the Chinese Ministry of State Security\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2009\nObserved Sectors\n\nDefense\nEducation\nEnergy\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHigh-Tech\nIT\nMedia\nMining\nNGOs\nlawyers\n\nObserved Countries\n\nBelgium\nChina\nGermany\nIndonesia\nItaly\nJapan\nNetherlands\nSwitzerland\nRussia\nUK\nUSA\n\nTools\n\n9002 RAT\nBlackCoffee\nBriba\nComfoo\nDeputyDog\nGh0st RAT\nHiKit\nJumpall\nLinfo\nNaid\nNerex\nPasam\nPoison Ivy\nPlugX\nVasport\nWiarp\nZoxRPC\nseveral 0-days for IE\n\nOperations\n\n2009: Operation Aurora\nFirst publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.\nThe attack has been aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted.

Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns, as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in unsolicited emails.  Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to which the actors want to gain access.\nIn contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims, “th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent.  Over the summer they compromised several sites, including a well-known Uyghur website written in that native language.\nThis group could be related to Axiom, Group 72.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAPT 20FireEyeAPT 8MandiantViolin PandaCrowdstrikeTH3BugPalo AltoCrawling TaurusPalo Alto\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2014\nObserved Sectors\n\nAviation\nChemical\nConstruction\nDefense\nEnergy\nEngineering\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nHigh-Tech\nPharmaceutical\nTelecommunications\nTransportation\nUyghur sympathizers\n\nObserved Countries\n\nBrazil\nChina\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nMexico\nPortugal\nSpain\nThailand\nUK\nUSA\nEast Asia\n\nTools\n\nBloodHound\nKeeThief\nKerberoast\nMimikatz\nPlugX\nPoison Ivy\nProcDump\nPsExec\nSharpHound\nSMBExec\nWinRAR\nXServer\nLiving off the Land\n\nOperations\n\n2017: Operation “Wocao”\nresources.fox-it.com/rs/170-CAK-271/images/201912_Report_Operation_Wocao.pdf\n\nInformation\n\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/recent-watering-hole-attacks-attributed-apt-group-th3bug-using-poison-ivy/\n\nPlaybook\n\npan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n73a85c37-08ef-4df4-ac98-7cb07b58715b\nLast Card Change\n2024-03-10"},"APT-29,-Cozy-Bear,-The-Dukes":{"slug":"APT-29,-Cozy-Bear,-The-Dukes","filePath":"APT 29, Cozy Bear, The Dukes.md","title":"APT 29, Cozy Bear, The Dukes","links":["Russia","Aerospace","Defense","Education","Embassies","Energy","Financial","Government","Healthcare","Law-enforcement","Media","NGOs","Pharmaceutical","Telecommunications","Transportation","Think-Tanks","Imagery","Australia","Azerbaijan","Belarus","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Chechnya","Chile","China","Cyprus","Czech","Denmark","France","Georgia","Germany","Hungary","India","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Kazakhstan","Kyrgyzstan","Latvia","Lebanon","Lithuania","Luxembourg","Mexico","Montenegro","Netherlands","New-Zealand","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Singapore","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","South-Korea","Switzerland","Thailand","Turkey","Uganda","UAE","UK","Ukraine","USA","Uzbekistan","NATO","7-Zip","AdFind","ATI-Agent","AtNow","BEATDROP","BloodHound","CEELOADER","CloudDuke","Cobalt-Strike","CosmicDuke","CozyDuke","Danfuan","EnvyScout","FatDuke","FoggyWeb","GeminiDuke","Geppei","GoldFinder","GoldMax","GraphicalNeutrino","GraphicalProton","HammerDuke","LiteDuke","MagicWeb","meek","Mimikatz","MiniDuke","OnionDuke","PinchDuke","PolyglotDuke","POSHSPY","PowerDuke","QUIETEXIT","RAINDROP","RegDuke","reGeorg","Rubeus","SeaDuke","Sharp-SMBExec","SharpView","Sibot","SoreFang","SUNBURST","SUNSPOT","SUPERNOVA","TEARDROP","TrailBlazer","WellMail","WellMess","WINELOADER","Living-off-the-Land","Sofacy,-APT-28,-Fancy-Bear,-Sednit"],"tags":[],"content":"APT 29, Cozy Bear, The Dukes\nDescription\n(F-Secure) The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making.\nThe Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs.\nThe Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations.\nThese campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break-in followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering.\nIn addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently engage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing different toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of these campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and security policy interests of the Russian Federation at those times.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAPT 29MandiantCozy BearCrowdStrikeThe DukesF-SecureGroup 100TalosYttriumMicrosoftIron HemlockSecureWorksMinidionisPalo AltoCloudLookKasperskyATK 7ThalesITG11IBMGrizzly SteppeUS GovernmentUNC2452FireEyeDark HaloVolexitySolarStormPalo AltoStellarParticleCrowdStrikeSilverFishProdaftNobeliumMicrosoftIron RitualSecureWorksCloaked UrsaPalo AltoBlueBravoRecorded FutureMidnight BlizzardMicrosoftUNC3524MandiantCraneflySymantecTEMP.MonkeysFireEyeBlue Dev 5PWCNobleBaronSentinelOneSolar PhoenixPalo AltoEarth KoshcheiTrend Micro\nCountry\n\nRussia\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2008\nObserved Sectors\n\nAerospace\nDefense\nEducation\nEmbassies\nEnergy\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nLaw enforcement\nMedia\nNGOs\nPharmaceutical\nTelecommunications\nTransportation\nThink Tanks\nImagery\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nAzerbaijan\nBelarus\nBelgium\nBrazil\nBulgaria\nCanada\nChechnya\nChile\nChina\nCyprus\nCzech\nDenmark\nFrance\nGeorgia\nGermany\nHungary\nIndia\nIreland\nIsrael\nItaly\nJapan\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyzstan\nLatvia\nLebanon\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMexico\nMontenegro\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nPoland\nPortugal\nRomania\nRussia\nSingapore\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSpain\nSouth Korea\nSwitzerland\nThailand\nTurkey\nUganda\nUAE\nUK\nUkraine\nUSA\nUzbekistan\nNATO\n\nTools\n\n7-Zip\nAdFind\nATI-Agent\nAtNow\nBEATDROP\nBloodHound\nCEELOADER\nCloudDuke\nCobalt Strike\nCosmicDuke\nCozyDuke\nDanfuan\nEnvyScout\nFatDuke\nFoggyWeb\nGeminiDuke\nGeppei\nGoldFinder\nGoldMax\nGraphicalNeutrino\nGraphicalProton\nHammerDuke\nLiteDuke\nMagicWeb\nmeek\nMimikatz\nMiniDuke\nOnionDuke\nPinchDuke\nPolyglotDuke\nPOSHSPY\nPowerDuke\nQUIETEXIT\nRAINDROP\nRegDuke\nreGeorg\nRubeus\nSeaDuke\nSharp-SMBExec\nSharpView\nSibot\nSoreFang\nSUNBURST\nSUNSPOT\nSUPERNOVA\nTEARDROP\nTrailBlazer\nWellMail\nWellMess\nWINELOADER\nLiving off the Land\n\nOperations\n\n2013-02: Since the original announcement, we have observed several new attacks using the same exploit (CVE-2013-0640) which drop other malware.

While Naikon, Lotus Panda shares some characteristics with APT 30, the two groups do not appear to be exact matches.\n(FireEye) When our Singapore-based FireEye labs team examined malware aimed predominantly at entities in Southeast Asia and India, we suspected that we were peering into a regionally focused cyber espionage operation. The malware revealed a decade-long operation focused on targets—government and commercial—who hold key political, economic, and military information about the region. This group, who we call APT30, stands out not only for their sustained activity and regional focus, but also for their continued success despite maintaining relatively consistent tools, tactics, and infrastructure since at least 2005.\nBased on our knowledge of APT30’s targeting activity and tools, their objective appears to be data theft as opposed to financial gain. APT30 has not been observed to target victims or data that can be readily monetized (for example, credit card data, personally identifiable information, or bank transfer credentials). Instead, their tools include functionality that allows them to identify and steal documents, including what appears to be an interest in documents that may be stored on air-gapped networks.\nThe group expresses a distinct interest in organizations and governments associated with ASEAN, particularly so around the time of official ASEAN meetings.\nMany of APT30’s decoy documents use topics related to Southeast Asia, India, border areas, and broader security and diplomatic issues. Decoy documents attached to spear phishing emails are frequently indicators of intended targeting because threat actors generally tailor these emails to entice their intended targets —who typically work on related issues—to click on the attachments and infect themselves.\nIn addition to APT30’s Southeast Asia and India focus, we’ve observed APT30 target journalists reporting on issues traditionally considered to be focal points for the Chinese Communist Party’s sense of legitimacy, such as corruption, the economy, and human rights. In China, the Communist Party has the ultimate authority over the government. China-based threat groups have targeted journalists before; we believe they often do so to get a better understanding on developing stories to anticipate unfavorable coverage and better position themselves to shape public messaging.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAPT 30MandiantOverride PandaCrowdStrikeCTG-5326SecureWorksBronze GenevaSecureWorksBronze SterlingSecureWorksRADIUMMicrosoftRaspberry TyphoonMicrosoft\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2005\nObserved Sectors\n\nDefense\nGovernment\n\nObserved Countries\n\nASEAN\nBhutan\nBrunei\nCambodia\nIndia\nIndonesia\nJapan\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMyanmar\nNepal\nPhilippines\nSaudi Arabia\nSingapore\nSouth Korea\nThailand\nVietnam\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nBackBend\nBackspace\nCreamsicle\nFlashflood\nGemcutter\nMilkmaid\nNetEagle\nOrangeade\nShipshape\nSpaceship\n\nInformation\n\nwww2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt30.pdf\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0013/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\na97aea4e-ac99-4506-89e6-ba1e5b766b0d\nLast Card Change\n2023-04-26"},"APT-31,-Judgment-Panda,-Zirconium":{"slug":"APT-31,-Judgment-Panda,-Zirconium","filePath":"APT 31, Judgment Panda, Zirconium.md","title":"APT 31, Judgment Panda, Zirconium","links":["Hafnium","China","Belarus","Canada","Czech","Finland","France","Mongolia","Norway","Russia","UK","USA","9002-RAT","China-Chopper","Gh0st-RAT","GrewApacha","HiKit","PlugX","Sakula-RAT","Trochilus-RAT"],"tags":[],"content":"APT 31, Judgment Panda, Zirconium\nDescription\nFireEye characterizes APT31 as an actor specialized on intellectual property theft, focusing on data and projects that make a particular organization competetive in its field.

However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government.\nAPT33 has targeted organizations – spanning multiple industries – headquartered in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production.\nAPT 33 seems to be closely related to OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene since at least 2017.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAPT 33MandiantElfinSymantecMagnalliumDragosHolmiumMicrosoftATK 35ThalesRefined KittenCrowdStrikeTA451ProofpointCobalt TrinitySecureWorksPeach SandstormMicrosoftYellow OrcPWCCurious SerpensPalo Alto\nCountry\n\nIran\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored, Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\nSabotage and destruction\n\nFirst Seen\n2013\nObserved Sectors\n\nAviation\nDefense\nEducation\nEnergy\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nHigh-Tech\nManufacturing\nMedia\nOil and gas\nPetrochemical\nTelecommunications\nothers\n\nObserved Countries\n\nIran\nIraq\nIsrael\nSaudi Arabia\nSouth Korea\nUAE\nUK\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nAutoIt backdoor\nDarkComet\nDistTrack\nEmpireProject\nFalseFont\nFilerase\nJuicyPotato\nLaZagne\nMimikatz\nNanoCore RAT\nNetWire RC\nPoshC2\nPowerBand\nPowerSploit\nPOWERTON\nPsList\nPupyRAT\nQuasarRAT\nRemcosRAT\nRuler\nSHAPESHIFT\nStoneDrill\nTickler\nTURNEDUP\nLiving off the Land\n\nOperations\n\n2019-03: Attacks on Multiple Organizations in Saudi Arabia and U.S.\nThe Elfin espionage group (aka APT33) has remained highly active over the past three years, attacking at least 50 organizations in Saudi Arabia, the United States, and a range of other countries.\nwww.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage\n2019-07: US Cyber Command has issued an alert via Twitter today about threat actors abusing an Outlook vulnerability to plant malware on government networks.\nThe vulnerability is CVE-2017-11774, a security bug that Microsoft patched in Outlook in the October 2017 Patch Tuesday.\nwww.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-issues-alert-about-hackers-exploiting-outlook-vulnerability/\n2019-11: More than a Dozen Obfuscated APT33 Botnets Used for Extreme Narrow Targeting\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/more-than-a-dozen-obfuscated-apt33-botnets-used-for-extreme-narrow-targeting/\n2023-02: Peach Sandstorm password spray campaigns enable intelligence collection at high-value targets\nwww.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/09/14/peach-sandstorm-password-spray-campaigns-enable-intelligence-collection-at-high-value-targets/\n2023-11: Microsoft: Hackers target defense firms with new FalseFont malware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-hackers-target-defense-firms-with-new-falsefont-malware/\n2024-04: Peach Sandstorm deploys new custom Tickler malware in long-running intelligence gathering operations\nwww.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/08/28/peach-sandstorm-deploys-new-custom-tickler-malware-in-long-running-intelligence-gathering-operations/\n\nInformation\n\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfin_Team\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0064/\n\nPlaybook\n\npan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n958e1f46-a2b6-4beb-8cb0-ddc90c08368e\nLast Card Change\n2024-10-23"},"APT-4,-Maverick-Panda,-Wisp-Team":{"slug":"APT-4,-Maverick-Panda,-Wisp-Team","filePath":"APT 4, Maverick Panda, Wisp Team.md","title":"APT 4, Maverick Panda, Wisp Team","links":["China","Aerospace","Aviation","Defense","Government","Telecommunications","USA","Sykipot","XMRig"],"tags":[],"content":"APT 4, Maverick Panda, Wisp Team\nDescription\n(Trend Micro) Sykipot has a history of primarily targeting US Defense Initial Base (DIB) and key industries such as telecommunications, computer hardware, government contractors, and aerospace.

Activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely state-sponsored activity. This is remarkable because explicit financially motivated targeting is unusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and evidence suggests these two motivations were balanced concurrently from 2014 onward.\n• APT41 overlaps at least partically with public reporting on group including Barium and Winnti Group, Wicked Panda. In some cases the primary observed similarity in the publicly reported Winnti activity was the use of the same malware – including HIGHNOON – across otherwise separate clusters of activity.\n• Previous FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting on the use of HIGHNOON and related activity was grouped together under both Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon and Mana, although we now understand this to be the work of several Chinese cyber espionage groups that share tools and digital certificates.\n• APT41 reflects our current understanding of what was previously reported as GREF, as well as additional indicators and activity gathered during our extensive review of our intelligence holdings.\nAPT 41 has 2 subgroups:\n\nSubgroup: Earth Longzhi\nSubgroup: Earth Freybug\n\nAlso see Earth Lusca and RedGolf.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAPT 41FireEyeDouble DragonFireEyeTG-2633SecureWorksBronze AtlasSecureWorksRed KelpiePWCBlackflySymantecEarth BakuTrend MicroSparklingGoblinESETGrayflySymantecTA415ProofpointBrazenBambooVolexity\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2012\nObserved Sectors\n\nConstruction\nDefense\nEducation\nEnergy\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nHigh-Tech\nHospitality\nManufacturing\nMedia\nOil and gas\nPetrochemical\nPharmaceutical\nRetail\nShipping and Logistics\nTelecommunications\nTransportation\nOnline video game companies\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nBahrain\nBrazil\nCanada\nChile\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nGeorgia\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIndonesia\nItaly\nJapan\nMalaysia\nMexico\nMyanmar\nNetherlands\nPakistan\nPhilippines\nPoland\nQatar\nSaudi Arabia\nSingapore\nSouth Korea\nSouth Africa\nSpain\nSri Lanka\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nThailand\nTurkey\nUAE\nUK\nUSA\nVietnam\n\nTools\n\n9002 RAT\nAceHash\nADORE.XSEC\nAntSword\nASPXSpy\nBarlaiy\nBEACON\nBlackCoffee\nBLUEBEAM\ncertutil\nChina Chopper\nCobalt Strike\nCOLDJAVA\nCrackshot\nCrossWalk\nDBoxAgent\nDEADEYE\nDEPLOYLOG\nDerusbi\nDIRTCLEANER\nDragonEgg\nDUSTPAN\nDUSTTRAP\nEasyNight\nFunnySwitch\nGearShift\nGh0st RAT\nHDRoot\nHighNoon\nHighNote\nHKDOOR\nHUI Loader\nJumpall\nKEYPLUG\nLATELUNCH\nLIFEBOAT\nLowkey\nMessageTap\nMeterpreter\nMimikatz\nMoonBounce\nMoonWalk\nnjRAT\nNTDSDump\nPACMAN\nPINEGROVE\nPipeMon\nPlugX\nPOTROAST\nPRIVATELOG\npwdump\nRedXOR\nROCKBOOT\nSAGEHIRE\nSerialVlogger\nShadowHammer\nShadowPad Winnti\nSideWalk\nSkip-2.0\nSPARKLOG\nSpeculoos\nSpyder\nSQLULDR2\nSTASHLOG\nSWEETCANDLE\nTERA\nTIDYELF\nVoldemort\nWIDETONE\nWINNKIT\nWinnti\nWINTERLOVE\nWyrmSpy\nxDll\nXDOOR\nXMRig\nZXShell\nLiving off the Land\n\nOperations\n\n2016 Autumn: Breach of TeamViewer\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/teamviewer-confirms-undisclosed-breach-from-2016/\n2017-07: ShadowPad is one of the largest known supply-chain attacks.

We further estimate with moderate confidence that APT42 operates on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO) based on targeting patterns that align with the organization’s operational mandates and priorities.\nActive since at least 2015, APT42 is characterized by highly targeted spear phishing and surveillance operations against individuals and organizations of strategic interest to Iran. The group’s operations, which are designed to build trust and rapport with their victims, have included accessing the personal and corporate email accounts of government officials, former Iranian policymakers or political figures, members of the Iranian diaspora and opposition groups, journalists, and academics who are involved in research on Iran. After gaining access, the group has deployed mobile malware capable of tracking victim locations, recording phone conversations, accessing videos and images, and extracting entire SMS inboxes.\nAPT42 has a demonstrated ability to alter its operational focus as Iran’s priorities evolve over time. We anticipate APT42 will continue to conduct cyber espionage operations in support of Iran’s strategic priorities in the long term based on their extensive operational history and imperviousness to public reporting and infrastructure takedowns.\nThe full published report covers APT42’s recent and historical activity dating back to at least 2015, the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures, targeting patterns, and elucidates historical connections to Magic Hound, APT 35, Cobalt Illusion, Charming Kitten.

APT5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries, but its focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies, especially information about satellite communications.\nAPT5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both industrial and military applications. The group subsequently stole communications related to the firm’s business relationship with a national military, including inventories and memoranda about specific products they provided.\nIn one case in late 2014, APT5 breached the network of an international telecommunications company.

The attacker improved its toolset during that time, making it stealthier, while the network infrastructure remained the same.\nGiven the final payload functionality and the subject of the attack, BlackBerry assesses with medium to high confidence that the goal of this attack was commercial cyber espionage.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAeroBladeBlackBerry\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2022\nObserved Sectors\n\nAerospace\n\nObserved Countries\n\nUSA\n\nInformation\n\nblogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/11/aeroblade-on-the-hunt-targeting-us-aerospace-industry\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n2c1a4c44-04ee-4b60-ba62-cfd0083550bc\nLast Card Change\n2024-01-16"},"Aerospace":{"slug":"Aerospace","filePath":"Aerospace.md","title":"Aerospace","links":["Aerospace"],"tags":[],"content":"Aerospace\nA page for the sector Aerospace."},"Afghanistan":{"slug":"Afghanistan","filePath":"Afghanistan.md","title":"Afghanistan","links":["Afghanistan"],"tags":[],"content":"Afghanistan\nA page for the country Afghanistan."},"Africa-and-Far-East":{"slug":"Africa-and-Far-East","filePath":"Africa and Far East.md","title":"Africa and Far East","links":["Africa-and-Far-East"],"tags":[],"content":"Africa and Far East\nA page for the country Africa and Far East."},"Africa,-the-Caribbean-and-Southeast-Asia":{"slug":"Africa,-the-Caribbean-and-Southeast-Asia","filePath":"Africa, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.md","title":"Africa, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia","links":["Africa,-the-Caribbean-and-Southeast-Asia"],"tags":[],"content":"Africa, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia\nA page for the country Africa, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia."},"Africa":{"slug":"Africa","filePath":"Africa.md","title":"Africa","links":["Africa"],"tags":[],"content":"Africa\nA page for the country Africa."},"Agent-Racoon":{"slug":"Agent-Racoon","filePath":"Agent Racoon.md","title":"Agent Racoon","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Agent Racoon\nDescription\n(Palo Alto) This malware family is written using the .NET framework and leverages the domain name service (DNS) protocol to create a covert channel and provide different backdoor functionalities.

Further analysis revealed that this activity is likely part of a much larger campaign impacting not only that region but also the United States, and throughout Europe and Asia.\nOur analysis of the delivery document revealed it was built to load a malicious macro-enabled document from a remote server via Template Injection. These macros use BlogSpot posts to obtain a script that uses multiple Pastebin pastes to download additional scripts, which ultimately result in the final payload being RevengeRAT configured with a duckdns[.]org domain for C2. During our research, we found several related delivery documents that followed the same process to ultimately install RevengeRAT hosted on Pastebin, which suggests the actors used these TTPs throughout their attack campaign.\nInitially, we believed this activity to be potentially associated with the Gorgon Group. Our hypothesis was based on the high level TTPs including the use of RevengeRAT. However, Unit 42 has not yet identified direct overlaps with other high-fidelity Gorgon Group indicators. Based on this, we are not able to assign this activity to the Gorgon group with an appropriate level of certainty.\nIn light of that, Unit 42 refers to the activity described in this blog as the Aggah Campaign based on the actor’s alias “hagga”, which was used to split data sent to the RevengeRAT C2 server and was the name of one of the Pastebin accounts used to host the RevengeRAT payloads.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverAggahPalo Alto\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\nFinancial gain\n\nFirst Seen\n2018\nObserved Sectors\n\nAutomotive\nEducation\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nHospitality\nManufacturing\nMedia\nRetail\nTechnology\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustria\nBahrain\nBrazil\nCanada\nChina\nEgypt\nFrance\nGermany\nIndia\nIreland\nIsrael\nItaly\nJapan\nNorway\nRomania\nRussia\nSaudi Arabia\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSweden\nTaiwan\nUK\nUAE\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nAgent Tesla\nAggah\nNanoCore RAT\nnjRAT\nRevengeRAT\nWarzone RAT\n\nOperations\n\n2018-12: Operation “Roma225”\nThe Cybaze-Yoroi ZLab researchers investigated a recent espionage malware implant weaponized to target companies in the Italian automotive sector.

The malware family typically maintains persistence through installing itself as a service.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameAurigaRiodrv\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nKeylogger\n\nInformation\n\nwww.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\ncontagiodump.blogspot.com/2013/03/mandiant-apt1-samples-categorized-by.html\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.auriga\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n2f8361b0-f1d1-4cc4-9c67-642df54a181a\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-23"},"Australia":{"slug":"Australia","filePath":"Australia.md","title":"Australia","links":["Australia"],"tags":[],"content":"Australia\nA page for the country Australia."},"Austria":{"slug":"Austria","filePath":"Austria.md","title":"Austria","links":["Austria"],"tags":[],"content":"Austria\nA page for the country Austria."},"AutoIt-backdoor":{"slug":"AutoIt-backdoor","filePath":"AutoIt backdoor.md","title":"AutoIt backdoor","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"AutoIt backdoor\nDescription\nAutoIt backdoor is malware that has been used by the actors responsible for the MONSOON campaign.

The ransomware also deletes the volume shadow copies and other system backups and typically demands a ransom ranging between 150 and 900. Since the ransomware uses strong encryption algorithms like AES256 and RSA2048, no decryptor is available and it is impossible to decrypt the file without the key that was used to encrypt it. This ransomware is sold similar to other Ransomware-as-a-service(RaaS) like REvil. Thus, even someone with limited technical background can become an “affiliate” to spread the malware. In return, the profit gets shared between the threat actor and the affiliate.

Once the victim enables the macros, it executes PowerShells and shellcode scripts for PowerSniff, installing a backdoor in the process. Its network scan capability makes it different from PowerSniff; it is unable to check if the systems infected is in the education or healthcare sector. The researchers also noted that it lacks the sandbox detection and anti-virus analysis evasion features, as well as the long-term persistence tools that its predecessor had.

Later that month, the same tactics and patterns were seen in attempts against an Iranian women’s activist – an individual commonly targeted by Iranian actors, such as Magic Hound, APT 35, Cobalt Illusion, Charming Kitten and the Sima campaign documented in our 2016 Black Hat talk. Recurrent patterns in hostnames, registrations, and phishing scripts provided a strong link between the two incidents, and older attempts were found that directly overlapped with these attacks. Over the course of the following months, several more attempts against the same individuals were observed, intended to steal credentials for iCloud and Gmail accounts.\nBahamut was also observed engaging in reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance attempts, intended to harvest IP addresses of emails accounts. One attempt impersonated BBC News Alerts, using timely content related to the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and other Gulf states as bait.

As opposed to typical cybercrime, the group likely conducts well-planned, disciplined, and methodical cyber operations more akin to careful espionage activities. Their malicious cyber operations have netted hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars and are likely a major source of funding for the North Korean regime. The group has always used a calculated approach, which allows them to sharpen their tactics, techniques, and procedures while evading detection. Over time, their operations have become increasingly complex and destructive. The tools and implants employed by this group are consistently complex and demonstrate a strong focus on effectiveness and operational security.\nNorth Korea’s intelligence apparatus controls a hacking team dedicated to robbing banks through remote internet access. To differentiate methods from other North Korean malicious cyber activity, the U.S. Government refers to this team as BeagleBoyz, who represent a subset of HIDDEN COBRA activity. The BeagleBoyz overlap to varying degrees with groups tracked by the cybersecurity industry as Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima and Subgroup: Bluenoroff, APT 38, Stardust Chollima and are responsible for the FASTCash ATM cash outs reported in October 2018, fraudulent abuse of compromised bank-operated SWIFT system endpoints since at least 2015, and lucrative cryptocurrency thefts. This illicit behavior has been identified by the United Nations (UN) DPRK Panel of Experts as evasion of UN Security Council resolutions, as it generates substantial revenue for North Korea. North Korea can use these funds for its UN-prohibited nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.

But in campaigns from July to August 2020, the group deployed Monero coin miners in attacks that targeted both the private sector and government institutions in France and Vietnam.\nBecause BISMUTH’s attacks involved techniques that ranged from typical to more advanced, devices with common threat activities like phishing and coin mining should be elevated and inspected for advanced threats. More importantly, organizations should prioritize reducing attack surface and hardening networks against the full range of attacks.

While not previously publicly documented, the variant has been in the wild since at least 2014. There are three primary differences between it and older Bisonal malware including a different cipher and encryption for C2 communication, and a large rewrite of the code for both network communication and maintaining persistence. To date, we have only collected 14 samples of this variant, indicating it may be sparingly used. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching the Microsoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the decoy PDF file’s contents.\nAttacks using Bisonal have been blogged about in the past. In 2013, both COSEINC and FireEye revealed attacks using Bisonal against Japanese organizations. In October 2017, AhnLab published a report called “Operation Bitter Biscuit,” an attack campaign against South Korea, Japan, India and Russia using Bisonal and its successors, Bioazih and Dexbia.

Given its numerous native options, Rust is highly customizable, which facilitates the ability to pivot and individualize attacks.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameBlackCatALPHVALPHVMNoberus\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nRansomware\nBig Game Hunting\n\nInformation\n\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/blackcat-ransomware/\nsymantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/noberus-blackcat-alphv-rust-ransomware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alphv-blackcat-this-years-most-sophisticated-ransomware/\nwww.intrinsec.com/alphv-ransomware-gang-analysis/\nwww.sentinelone.com/labs/blackcat-ransomware-highly-configurable-rust-driven-raas-on-the-prowl-for-victims/\nwww.varonis.com/blog/alphv-blackcat-ransomware\ncybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/blackcat-ransomware\nwww.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs.-blackcat-ransomware\nblog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/from-blackmatter-to-blackcat-analyzing.html\nsecurelist.com/a-bad-luck-blackcat/106254/\nwww.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/blackcat-purveyor-shows-ransomware-operators-have-nine-lives\nwww.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/d/an-investigation-of-the-blackcat-ransomware.html\nwww.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220420.pdf\nwww.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/06/13/the-many-lives-of-blackcat-ransomware/\nwww.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/e/blackcat-ransomware-deploys-new-signed-kernel-driver.html\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S1068\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.blackcat\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.blackcat\n\nPlaybook\n\npan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nb7260119-d178-4d47-9a11-2d32c0d4cd9c\nLast Card Change\n2023-06-22"},"BlackCoffee":{"slug":"BlackCoffee","filePath":"BlackCoffee.md","title":"BlackCoffee","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"BlackCoffee\nDescription\n(Novetta) ZoxPNG is a very simple RAT that uses the PNG image file format as the carrier for data going to and from the C2 server.

Initially, it was designed as a toolkit for creating botnets for conducting DDoS attacks. It supported a variety of flooding commands including protocols like ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP, HTTP and DNS. Among the high profile targets of cyber attacks utilising BE1 were a Norwegian bank and government websites in Georgia three weeks before Russo-Georgian War.\nVersion 2 of BlackEnergy, BE2, came in 2008 with a complete code rewrite that introduced a protective layer, a kernel-mode rootkit and a modular architecture. Plugins included mostly DDoS attacks, a spam plugin and two banking authentication plugins to steal from Russian nad Ukrainian banks. The banking plugin was paired with a module designed to destroy the filesystem. Moreover, BE2 was able to\n\ndownload and execute a remote file;\nexecute a local file on the infected computer;\nupdate the bot and its plugins;\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert warning that BE2 was leveraging the human-machine interfaces of industrial control systems like GE CIMPLICITY, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC to gain access to critical infrastructure networks.\nIn 2014, the BlackEnergy toolkit, BE3, switched to a lighter footprint with no kernel-mode driver component. Its plugins included:\n\noperations with victim’s filesystem\nspreading with a parasitic infector\nspying features like keylogging, screenshoots or a robust password stealer\nTeam viewer and a simple pseudo “remote desktop”\nlisting Windows accounts and scanning network\ndestroying the system\n\nTypical for distribution of BE3 was heavy use of spear-phishing emails containing Microsoft Word or Excel documents with a malicious VBA macro, Rich Text Format (RTF) documents embedding exploits or a PowerPoint presentation with zero-day exploit CVE-2014-4114.\nOn 23 December 2015, attackers behind the BlackEnergy malware successfully caused power outages for several hours in different regions of Ukraine. This cyber sabotage against three energy companies has been confirmed by the Ukrainian government.

After investigation, it became clear that this newcomer is derived from the code of the Xerxes banking malware, which itself is a strain of the LokiBot Android banking Trojan. The source code of the Xerxes malware was made public by its author around May 2019, which means that it is accessible to any threat actor.\nTechnical aspects aside, one of the interesting differentiators of BlackRock is its target list; it contains an important number of social, networking, communication and dating applications. So far, many of those applications haven’t been observed in target lists for other existing banking Trojans. It therefore seems that the actors behind BlackRock are trying to abuse the grow in online socializing that increased rapidly in the last months due to the pandemic situation.\nBlackRock offers a quite common set of capabilities compared to average Android banking Trojans. It can perform the infamous overlay attacks, send, spam and steal SMS messages, lock the victim in the launcher activity (HOME screen of the device), steal and hide notifications, deflect usage of Antivirus software on the device and act as a keylogger. Interestingly, the Xerxes Trojan itself offers more features, but it seems that actors have removed some of them in order to only keep those that they consider useful to steal personal information.\nNote: This malware was initially named BlackRock and later renamed to AmpleBot.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameBlackRockAmpleBot\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nReconnaissance\nBackdoor\nBanking trojan\nKeylogger\nInfo stealer\nCredential stealer\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nwww.threatfabric.com/blogs/blackrock_the_trojan_that_wanted_to_get_them_all.html\nwww.threatfabric.com/blogs/alien_the_story_of_cerberus_demise.html\nwww.threatfabric.com/blogs/ermac-another-cerberus-reborn.html\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/apk.amplebot\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n8d0ec018-69e1-4f6e-b7ef-b35e6a0dec39\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-29"},"BlackSmith":{"slug":"BlackSmith","filePath":"BlackSmith.md","title":"BlackSmith","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"BlackSmith\nDescription\n(Proofpoint) With BlackSmith, TA453 has created a sophisticated intelligence collection toolkit and streamlined its malware functions from a disparate set of individual scripts into a full-service PowerShell trojan.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameBlackSmith\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nInfo stealer\n\nInformation\n\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/best-laid-plans-ta453-targets-religious-figure-fake-podcast-invite-delivering\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n87eb68be-5b44-4229-9357-89986d18e5e0\nLast Card Change\n2024-08-27"},"BlackTech,-Circuit-Panda,-Radio-Panda":{"slug":"BlackTech,-Circuit-Panda,-Radio-Panda","filePath":"BlackTech, Circuit Panda, Radio Panda.md","title":"BlackTech, Circuit Panda, Radio Panda","links":["China","Construction","Financial","Government","Healthcare","Media","Technology","Hong-Kong","Japan","Taiwan","USA","BendyBear","BIFROST","Bluether","DRIGO","Flagpro","Gh0stTimes","IconDown","KIVARS","PLEAD","XBOW","Living-off-the-Land"],"tags":[],"content":"BlackTech, Circuit Panda, Radio Panda\nDescription\n(Trend Micro) BlackTech is a cyber espionage group operating against targets in East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and occasionally, Japan and Hong Kong.

Multiple papers and talks have been released covering this campaign, which used the ELIRKS backdoor when it was first discovered in 2012. It is known for using blogs and microblogging services to hide the location of its actual command-and-control (C&amp;C) servers. This allows an attacker to change the C&amp;C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts.\nLike most campaigns, Blackgear has evolved over time. Our research indicates that it has started targeting Japanese users. Two things led us to this conclusion: first, the fake documents that are used as part of its infection routines are now in Japanese. Secondly, it is now using blogging sites and microblogging services based in Japan for its C&amp;C activity.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverBlackgearTrend MicroTopgear?\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2018\nObserved Countries\n\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nTaiwan\n\nTools\n\nComnie\nElirks\nProtux\n\nOperations\n\n2018-07: Resurfaces, Abuses Social Media for C&amp;C Communication\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/blackgear-cyberespionage-campaign-resurfaces-abuses-social-media-for-cc-communication/\n\nInformation\n\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/blackgear-espionage-campaign-evolves-adds-japan-target-list/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n9d6a918f-c75c-41c4-842d-3ad79c5a6642\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-14"},"Blackwood":{"slug":"Blackwood","filePath":"Blackwood.md","title":"Blackwood","links":["China","Manufacturing","Japan","UK","NSPX30"],"tags":[],"content":"Blackwood\nDescription\n(ESET) Blackwood is a China-aligned APT group active since at least 2018, engaging in cyberespionage operations against Chinese and Japanese individuals and companies.

And while banking Trojans or targeted attacks are quite specific in what they do, information stealers are by far less discriminatory and thus end up affecting a greater number of people and organizations.\nThat brings us to CoreBot, a new information stealer discovered and analyzed by IBM Security X-Force researchers, who indicate this is one malware piece to watch out for. CoreBot appears to be quite modular, which means that its structure and internal makeup were programmed in a way that allows for the easy adding of new data theft and endpoint control mechanisms.\nCoreBot was discovered while the researchers were studying the activity of malware on Trusteer-protected enterprise endpoints. The malware’s compiled file was named “core” by its developer. Antivirus engines do not specify this malware’s name yet and detect it under generic names such as Dynamer!ac or Eldorado. But while CoreBot may appear artless at first glance, without real-time theft capabilities, it is more interesting on the inside.\nCoreBot has been observed to be distributed by DinaBot (operated by Scully Spider, TA547).\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverBoson SpiderCrowdStrike\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\n\nFirst Seen\n2015\nObserved Sectors\n\nFinancial\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nCanada\nJapan\nUK\nUSA\nEurope\n\nTools\n\nCoreBot\n\nOperations\n\n2017-11: Spotted by researchers at Deep Instinct, a new version of CoreBot is being distributed in spam email campaigns with the intention of stealing information from customers of Canadian banking websites.\nCustomers of TD, Des-Jardins, RBC, Scotia Bank, Banque National are all targeted by those behind the campaign, with successful execution of the malware allowing the attackers to steal the credentials of infected users as they login into these sites.\nwww.zdnet.com/article/corebot-banking-trojan-malware-returns-after-two-year-break/\n\nInformation\n\ngo.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report_BosonSpider.pdf\nsecurityintelligence.com/watch-out-for-corebot-new-stealer-in-the-wild/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n165f23ac-4e69-433d-bc3a-5e8acd384c16\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-15"},"Boss-Spider,-Gold-Lowell":{"slug":"Boss-Spider,-Gold-Lowell","filePath":"Boss Spider, Gold Lowell.md","title":"Boss Spider, Gold Lowell","links":["Iran","Education","Government","Healthcare","Mimikatz","PsExec","SamSam","SDelete"],"tags":[],"content":"Boss Spider, Gold Lowell\nDescription\n(SecureWorks) In late 2015, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers began tracking financially motivated campaigns leveraging SamSam ransomware (also known as Samas and SamsamCrypt). CTU researchers associate this activity with the Gold Lowell threat group. Gold Lowell typically scans for and exploits known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems to gain an initial foothold in a victim’s network. The threat actors then deploy the SamSam ransomware and demand payment to decrypt the victim’s files. The consistent tools and behaviors associated with SamSam intrusions since 2015 suggest that Gold Lowell is either a defined group or a collection of closely affiliated threat actors. Applying security updates in a timely manner and regularly monitoring for anomalous behaviors on Internet-facing systems are effective defenses against these tactics.

In several samples, CASHY200 used randomly generated identifiers that are stored in the registry at HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Cashe\\index and used the command value 200 to communicate with the C2 server.

As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.\n(Yahoo) In September 2018, Bolton announced that Trump had signed a presidential directive easing Obama-era rules governing military cyber operations. Although the administration disclosed the existence of that directive — known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 — the underlying rules of engagement for military cyber operations remain secret. The administration also kept secret the CIA finding, which gave the agency its new authorities.\nFormer officials declined to speak in detail about cyber operations the CIA has carried out as a result of the finding, but they said the agency has already conducted covert hack-and-dump actions aimed at both Iran and Russia.\nThis more permissive environment may also intensify concerns about the CIA’s ability to secure its hacking arsenal. In 2017, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools known as “Vault 7” (see [8].) The leak, which a partially declassified CIA assessment called “the largest data loss in CIA history,” was made possible by “woefully lax” security practices at the CIA’s top hacker unit, the assessment said.\nThe CIA was also one of the parties involved in Operation Olympic Games where Stuxnet was deployed in Iran.\nWhile not strictly related to APT activity and not just involving the CIA, the following publication in 3 parts sheds more light:\n\nforeignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/china-stolen-us-data-exposed-cia-operatives-spy-networks/\nforeignpolicy.com/2020/12/22/china-us-data-intelligence-cybersecurity-xi-jinping/\nforeignpolicy.com/2020/12/23/china-tech-giants-process-stolen-data-spy-agencies/\n\nThe CIA has 2 subgroups:\n\nSubgroup: Longhorn, The Lamberts.\n[[Subgroup: [Unnamed group USA]]].\n\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverCIAreal nameCentral Intelligence Agencyreal name\nCountry\n\nUSA\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\nSabotage and destruction\n\nFirst Seen\n1947\nObserved Countries\n\nWorldwide\n\nOperations\n\n2018-09: The Central Intelligence Agency has conducted a series of covert cyber operations against Iran and other targets since winning a secret victory in 2018 when President Trump signed what amounts to a sweeping authorization for such activities, according to former U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter.\nnews.yahoo.com/secret-trump-order-gives-cia-more-powers-to-launch-cyberattacks-090015219.html\nAlso see [[Subgroup: [Unnamed group USA]]].\n\nCounter Operations\n\n2014-07: Germany expels CIA official in US spy row\nwww.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28243933\n\nInformation\n\nwww.washingtonpost.com/national-security/elite-cia-unit-that-developed-hacking-tools-failed-to-secure-its-own-systems-allowing-massive-leak-an-internal-report-found/2020/06/15/502e3456-ae9d-11ea-8f56-63f38c990077_story.html\nwww.washingtonpost.com/national-security/swiss-report-reveals-new-details-on-cia-spying-operation/2020/11/10/c93ca7fc-2386-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency\n\nOther Information\nUuid\na3785768-7d9e-4cf7-9fed-77a2267a90d5\nLast Card Change\n2021-01-07"},"CIS":{"slug":"CIS","filePath":"CIS.md","title":"CIS","links":["CIS"],"tags":[],"content":"CIS\nA page for the country CIS."},"CLAMBLING":{"slug":"CLAMBLING","filePath":"CLAMBLING.md","title":"CLAMBLING","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"CLAMBLING\nDescription\n(Trend Micro) This backdoor is written in the C++ language with classes that inherit from virtual classes.

While Microsoft constantly tracks a number of activity groups with varying degrees of Russian government affiliation, the emergence of a novel GRU affiliated actor, particularly one which has conducted destructive cyber operations likely supporting broader military objectives in Ukraine, is a notable development in the Russian cyber threat landscape. A month before Russia invaded Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard foreshadowed future destructive activity when it created and deployed WhisperGate, a destructive capability that wipes Master Boot Records (MBRs), against Ukrainian government organizations. Cadet Blizzard is also linked to the defacements of several Ukrainian organization websites, as well as multiple operations, including the hack-and-leak forum known as “Free Civilian”.\nMicrosoft has tracked Cadet Blizzard since the deployment of WhisperGate in January 2022. We assess that they have been operational in some capacity since at least 2020 and continue to perform network operations through the present. Operationally consistent with the remit and assessed objectives of GRU-led operations throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard has engaged in focused destructive attacks, espionage, and information operations in regionally significant areas. Cadet Blizzard’s operations, though comparatively less prolific in both scale and scope to more established threat actors such as Seashell Blizzard, are structured to deliver impact and frequently run the risk of hampering continuity of network operations and exposing sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations.

More specifically, many of the known targets have a clear relation to foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus.\nThis targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign and security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting in the described attacks that would suggest a financial motive.\nIt is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances. While we don’t yet know enough to fully understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the existence of connections between the Callisto Group and criminal actors.\nWhile the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group’s activity is a nation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal element. Finally, the infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure contain links to at least Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure, and in WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure.\nIt is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above findings. For example, a cybercrime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit of a government agency, is one potential explanation.

It also refers to malware of the same name (Carbanak). It is sometimes referred to as FIN7, but these appear to be two groups using the same Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately.\n(Kaspersky) From late 2013 onwards, several banks and financial institutions have been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be financial gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet (.CPL) files attached.

attackers to compromise the victim’s machine once the exploit, either in the spear phishing email or exploit kit, successfully executes its payload. This section provides a functional analysis of Carbanak’s capabilities.\nCarbanak copies itself into “%system32%\\com” with the name “svchost.exe” with the file attributes: system, hidden and read-only. The original file created by the exploit payload is then deleted.\nTo ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new service. The naming syntax is “Sys” where ServiceName is any existing service randomly chosen, with the first character deleted. For example, if the existing service ́s name is “aspnet” and the visible name is “Asp.net state service”, the service created by the malware would be “aspnetSys” with a visible name of “Sp.net state service”.\nBefore creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local privilege escalation.

While not as sophisticated as HenBox, certain samples of CarbonSteal do make use of a combination of native libraries and DEX classes, while others do not and are much simpler.\nHallmarks of CarbonSteal include extensive audio recording functionality in a variety of codecs and audio formats, as well as the capability in later samples to control an infected device through specially crafted SMS messages. Attackers can also perform audio surveillance through the malware’s ability to silently answer a call from a specific phone number and allow the attacker to listen in to sounds around an infected device. Based on this functionality, we suspect that CarbonSteal might be deployed in areas with insufficient or no mobile data coverage.\nSamples of CarbonSteal and HenBox also use the same non-compromised signing certificates in many cases, suggesting the actor behind their deployment is the same. Furthermore, overlapping validity dates of these certificates may indicate that the samples were produced around the same time frame.

APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39’s targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.\nAPT39’s focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns.

We believe these attacks originated from the same threat actor – Chimera – as  these attacks utilized similar tactics, techniques and even the same customized malware. The actor likely harvested various valid credentials via phishing emails or data breaches as their starting point to conduct their cyber attack on the vendors. Cobalt Strike was later used as their main RAT tool. To avoid detection, the Cobalt Strike RAT was often masqueraded as a Google Chrome Update. The RAT would then connect back to their C2 server. As these servers were in a public cloud server, it made it difficult to track. Subsequently, by compromising the AD server, the delicate malware – SkeletonKeyInjector – was invoked to implant a general key to allow LM, persistence and defense evasion. Although this malware was discovered for the first time, we have high confidence that these attacks were conducted by the same threat actor.

The web shell works on different platforms, but in this case, we focused only on compromised Windows hosts. China Chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors such as Leviathan and Threat Group-3390, but during our investigation we’ve seen actors with varying skill levels.\nIn our research, we discovered both Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apache web servers compromised with China Chopper web shells. We do not have additional data about how the web shell was installed, but there are several web application frameworks such as older versions of Oracle WebLogic or WordPress that may have been targeted with known remote code execution or file inclusion exploits.\nChina Chopper provides the actor with a simple GUI that allows them to configure servers to connect to and generate server-side code that must be added to the targeted website code in order to communicate.\nThe server-side code is extremely simple and contains, depending on the application platform, just a single line of code. The backdoor supports .NET Active Server Pages or PHP.\nWe cannot be sure if the simplicity of the server code was a deliberate decision on the part of the China Chopper developers to make detection more difficult, but using pattern matching on such as short snippet may produce some false positive detections.\nThe China Chopper client communicates with affected servers using HTTP POST requests. The only function of the server-side code is to evaluate the request parameter specified during the configuration of the server code in the client GUI. In our example, the expected parameter name is ‘test.’ The communication over HTTP can be easily spotted in the network packet captures.\nChina Chopper contains a remote shell (Virtual Terminal) function that has a first suggested command of ‘netstat an|find ‘ESTABLISHED.” and it is very likely that this command will be seen in process creation logs on affected systems.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameChina ChopperCHINACHOPPERSinoChopper\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nblog.talosintelligence.com/2019/08/china-chopper-still-active-9-years-later.html\ninformationonsecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/china-chopper-webshell.html\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-i.html\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries.html\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Chopper\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0020/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.chinachopper\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf712900d-e7eb-4873-93b7-eefd7aba61c2\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-28"},"China":{"slug":"China","filePath":"China.md","title":"China","links":["China"],"tags":[],"content":"China\nA page for the country China."},"Chinese-institutions-abroad":{"slug":"Chinese-institutions-abroad","filePath":"Chinese institutions abroad.md","title":"Chinese institutions abroad","links":["Chinese-institutions-abroad"],"tags":[],"content":"Chinese institutions abroad\nA page for the sector Chinese institutions abroad."},"Chinoxy":{"slug":"Chinoxy","filePath":"Chinoxy.md","title":"Chinoxy","links":["ccf32"],"tags":[],"content":"Chinoxy\nDescription\n(Bitdefender) In the context of the current attack, the Chinoxy backdoor was mainly used to execute ccf32.exe for data collection.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameChinoxy\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nInfo stealer\n\nInformation\n\nwww.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/379/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chinese-APT.pdf\nmedium.com/@Sebdraven/how-to-unpack-chinoxy-backdoor-and-decipher-the-configuration-of-the-backdoor-4ffd98ca2a02\nnao-sec.org/2021/01/royal-road-redive.html\nwww.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf\ncommunity.riskiq.com/article/56fa1b2f\nmedium.com/@Sebdraven/new-version-of-chinoxy-backdoor-using-covid19-document-lure-83fa294c0746\ndocuments.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-finding-APTX-attributing-attacks-via-MITRE-TTPs.pdf\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S1041/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.chinoxy\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n29d70c9e-995a-43f8-8ac6-c9c5c446fd6f\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-30"},"Chisel":{"slug":"Chisel","filePath":"Chisel.md","title":"Chisel","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chisel\nDescription\nNo description available yet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameChisel\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nTunneling\n\nInformation\n\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-sandworm-hackers-targeted-20-critical-orgs-in-ukraine/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.chisel\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.chisel\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n3329f788-108a-4143-b372-2b1ee30349b5\nLast Card Change\n2024-04-23"},"Chocopop":{"slug":"Chocopop","filePath":"Chocopop.md","title":"Chocopop","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chocopop\nDescription\nNo description available yet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameChocopop\nCategory\nMalware\nInformation\n\nsearch.edwardsnowden.com/docs/PayattentiontothatmanbehindthecurtainDiscoveringaliensonCNEinfrastructure2015-01-17_nsadocs_snowden_doc\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf52c11ce-2a91-4dd0-b428-b45968be41c4\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-20"},"ChromeCookiesView":{"slug":"ChromeCookiesView","filePath":"ChromeCookiesView.md","title":"ChromeCookiesView","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"ChromeCookiesView\nDescription\nChromeCookiesView is an alternative to the standard internal cookies viewer of Google Chrome Web browser. it displays the list of all cookies stored by Google Chrome Web browser, and allows you to easily delete unwanted cookies.

Circles is affiliated with NSO Group, which develops the oft-abused Pegasus spyware.\nCircles, whose products work without hacking the phone itself, says they sell only to nation-states. According to leaked documents, Circles customers can purchase a system that they connect to their local telecommunications companies’ infrastructure, or can use a separate system called the “Circles Cloud,” which interconnects with telecommunications companies around the world.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, all U.S. wireless networks are vulnerable to the types of weaknesses reportedly exploited by Circles. A majority of networks around the globe are similarly vulnerable.\nUsing Internet scanning, we found a unique signature associated with the hostnames of Check Point firewalls used in Circles deployments. This scanning enabled us to identify Circles deployments in at least 25 countries.\nWhile companies selling exploitation of the global cellular system tend to operate in secrecy, one company has emerged as a known player: Circles. The company was reportedly founded in 2008, acquired in 2014 by Francisco Partners, and then merged with NSO Group.

The malware toolset used for this campaign was the previously unseen CloudDuke and we believe that the July campaign marks the first time that this toolset was deployed by the Dukes, other than possible small-scale testing.\nThe CloudDuke toolset consists of at least a loader, a downloader, and two backdoor variants. Both backdoors (internally referred to by their authors as “BastionSolution” and “OneDriveSolution”) essentially allow the operator to remotely execute commands on the compromised machine. The way in which each backdoor does so however is significantly different. While the BastionSolution variant simply retrieves commands from a hard-coded C&amp;C server controlled by the Dukes, the OneDriveSolution utilizes Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage service for communicating with its masters, making it significantly harder for defenders to notice the traffic and block the communication channel. What is most significant about the July 2015 CloudDuke campaign is the timeline. The campaign appeared to consist of two distinct waves of spear-phishing, one during the first days of July and the other starting from the 20th of the month. Details of the first wave, including a thorough technical analysis of CloudDuke, was published by Palo Alto Networks on 14th July.

The malware leverages cloud resources as its command and control (C2) servers, accessing them through APIs using authentication tokens.

MWI is a tool sold on underground markets for creating exploit-laden documents, generally used in targeted attacks. We previously reported about MWI when it added support for CVE-2016-4117. After the latest update, MWI is now using CVE-2017-0199 to launch an HTML Application (HTA) used for both information collection and payload execution.\nThis activity targets organizations in the financial vertical including banks, banking software vendors, and ATM software and hardware vendors.

The second, which ran from September 20 to 21, used an exploit for CVE-2017-8759 (patched last September), a code injection/remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft’s .NET Framework. The vulnerability was used to retrieve and execute Cobalt Strike from a remote server they controlled.\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cobalt-spam-runs-use-macros-cve-2017-8759-exploit/\n2017-11: On Tuesday, November 21, a massive spear-phishing campaign began targeting individual employees at various financial institutions, mostly in Russia and Turkey. Purporting to provide info on changes to ‘SWIFT’ terms, the email contained a single attachment with no text in the body.

It was like a challenge: phishing emails were sent acting as a major anti-virus vendor. Bank employees received a “complaint”, in English, that their computers allegedly violated legislation.\nwww.group-ib.com/blog/renaissance\n2018-09: In 2018, CTU researchers observed several GOLD KINGSWOOD campaigns involving SpicyOmelette, a tool used by the group during initial exploitation of an organization.

It shows the simplicity of the attack delivery employed by this group.\nThe attack reinforces the fact that email is still one of the primary attack vectors we continuously observe. This attack begins by targeting employees at several banking entities across the globe using an email with subject “Confirmations on October 16, 2018”.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-techniques-uncover-attribute-cobalt-gang-commodity-builders-infrastructure-revealed/\n2019-10: Magecart Group 4: A link with Cobalt Group?\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/10/magecart-group-4-a-link-with-cobalt-group/\n\nCounter Operations\n\n2018-03: Mastermind behind EUR 1 billion cyber bank robbery arrested in Spain\nwww.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/mastermind-behind-eur-1-billion-cyber-bank-robbery-arrested-in-spain\n2018-08: Three Carbanak cyber heist gang members arrested\nwww.computerweekly.com/news/252446153/Three-Carbanak-cyber-heist-gang-members-arrested\n\nInformation\n\nwww.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/Cobalt-2017-eng.pdf\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-september-cobalt-spider/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0080/\n\nPlaybook\n\npan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nd8339e9a-c946-4304-aac4-722d8652d273\nLast Card Change\n2024-03-10"},"Cobalt-Strike":{"slug":"Cobalt-Strike","filePath":"Cobalt Strike.md","title":"Cobalt Strike","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Cobalt Strike\nDescription\nCobalt Strike is a paid penetration testing product that allows an attacker to deploy an agent named ‘Beacon’ on the victim machine. Beacon includes a wealth of functionality to the attacker, including, but not limited to command execution, key logging, file transfer, SOCKS proxying, privilege escalation, mimikatz, port scanning and lateral movement. Beacon is in-memory/file-less, in that it consists of stageless or multi-stage shellcode that once loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader, will reflectively load itself into the memory of a process without touching the disk. It supports C2 and staging over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB named pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP; Beacons can be daisy-chained.

This control introduces the novel ability of skipping the encryption of local files and only targeting networked SMB shares, including those from IP addresses specifically provided by the adversary. This is a very rare ability that’s previously been seen with the Sodinokibi ransomware family.\nAnother new technique, documented in very few ransomware families, is the use of the Windows Restart Manager to ensure that all files can be encrypted.

Given the group’s specific interest in infrastructure operations, rapidly improving capabilities, and history of aggressive targeting, Dragos considers this group a primary threat to the ICS industry.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverCovelliteDragosCTG-2460SecureWorksNickel AcademySecureWorksBlack ArtemisPWC\nCountry\n\nNorth Korea\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\n\nObserved Countries\n\nUSA\nEurope and East Asia\n\nInformation\n\ndragos.com/resource/covellite/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf04ded49-5b0e-4422-9c6c-4c6e2ed7d3d3\nLast Card Change\n2021-01-07"},"Covid-19-research-organizations,-religious-movements-that-are-banned-in-Mainland-China,-pro-democracy-and-human-rights-political-organizations-and-various-cryptocurrency-trading-platforms":{"slug":"Covid-19-research-organizations,-religious-movements-that-are-banned-in-Mainland-China,-pro-democracy-and-human-rights-political-organizations-and-various-cryptocurrency-trading-platforms","filePath":"Covid-19 research organizations, religious movements that are banned in Mainland China, pro-democracy and human rights political organizations and various cryptocurrency trading platforms.md","title":"Covid-19 research organizations, religious movements that are banned in Mainland China, pro-democracy and human rights political organizations and various cryptocurrency trading platforms","links":["Covid-19-research-organizations,-religious-movements-that-are-banned-in-Mainland-China,-pro-democracy-and-human-rights-political-organizations-and-various-cryptocurrency-trading-platforms"],"tags":[],"content":"Covid-19 research organizations, religious movements that are banned in Mainland China, pro-democracy and human rights political organizations and various cryptocurrency trading platforms\nA page for the sector Covid-19 research organizations, religious movements that are banned in Mainland China, pro-democracy and human rights political organizations and various cryptocurrency trading platforms."},"Coyote":{"slug":"Coyote","filePath":"Coyote.md","title":"Coyote","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coyote\nDescription\n(Kaspersky) This malware utilizes the Squirrel installer for distribution, leveraging NodeJS and a relatively new multiplatform programming language called Nim as a loader to complete its infection.

Traditionally, ransomware disabled victims’ access to their computers through non-destructive means until the victims paid for the computers’ release.\nEarly CryptoWall variants closely mimicked both the behavior and appearance of the genuine CryptoLocker. The exact infection vector of these early infections is not known as of this publication, but anecdotal reports from victims suggest the malware arrived as an email attachment or drive-by download.

Western media sources, as well as analysts who have studied the QCF, have stated that it is actually an Iranian front. Cyber security analyst Dancho Danchev performed the most authoritative open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis on the issue of the group’s links to Iran, aimed at exposing one of the individuals in the group, while former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman told C-Span that he believed that Iran’s government was sponsoring the group’s attacks on U.S. banks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. Additionally, The New York Times quoted unnamed U.S. intelligence officials stating that the ‘group is a convenient cover for Iran.’\nThe QCF claims to have attacked Bank of America, the New York Stock Exchange, Capital One Financial Corp, SunTrust Banks Inc., BB&amp;T, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase &amp; CO, PNC Financial Services, U.S. Bancorp, Citigroup Citibank, Wells Fargo &amp; Company, Ally Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp, Zions Bancorporation, Union Bank, Comerica, Citizens Bank, Umpqua Bank, People’s United Bank, University Federal Credit Union, Patelco Credit Union, American Express, KeyCorp, Ameriprise Financial, Citizens Financial, BBVA Compass, UMB Financial Corporation, M&amp;T Bank, Bank of the West, Regions Financial Corp, Euronext, and Synovus Financial Corporation.\nRecorded Future found a possible overlap with Desert Falcons.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverCyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassamself givenQassam Cyber Fightersself givenQCFself givenFraternal JackalCrowdStrike\nCountry\n\nIran\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nSabotage and destruction\n\nFirst Seen\n2012\nObserved Sectors\n\nFinancial\n\nObserved Countries\n\nUSA\n\nCounter Operations\n\n2016-05: U.S. Accuses 7 Iranians Of Cyberattacks On Banks And Dam\nwww.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/03/24/iran-hackers-charged-bank-ddos-attacks-banks/\n\nInformation\n\nwww.memri.org/reports/rise-and-fall-qassam-cyber-fighters-arab-hacking-group-or-iranian-cyber-front-review-its\nddanchev.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/dissecting-operation-ababil-osint.html\nkrebsonsecurity.com/tag/izz-ad-din-al-qassam-cyber-fighters/\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ababil\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf64252d6-0e52-4fd9-8151-06bf35dcd905\nLast Card Change\n2023-11-29"},"CyberAv3ngers":{"slug":"CyberAv3ngers","filePath":"CyberAv3ngers.md","title":"CyberAv3ngers","links":["Iran","Industrial","Ireland","Israel","USA"],"tags":[],"content":"CyberAv3ngers\nDescription\n(CISA) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD)—hereafter referred to as ‘the authoring agencies’—are disseminating this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight continued malicious cyber activity against operational technology devices by Iranian Government Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-affiliated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) cyber actors.\nThe IRGC is an Iranian military organization that the United States designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2019.

The program was discontinued, partially due to its use in the Syrian civil war to monitor activists but also due to its author’s fear of being arrested for unnamed reasons. As of August 2018, the program’s development ‘has ceased indefinitely’, and downloads are no longer offered on its official website.\nDarkComet allows a user to control the system with a graphical user interface.

Depending on the registrar service chosen, this could be seen as another cost control measure.  The actors often used typo-squatting to slightly alter a legitimate domain name. In contrast, the registration information used accurate spelling, possibly indicating the domain naming was intentional, typos included.

However, they maintained the same targeting, as well as several key malware characteristics, such as similar decryption keys for configuration files.\nThese recent samples, discovered in late 2019, are the focus of this section on DoubleAgent.

SparkRAT is multi-platform, feature-rich, and frequently updated with new features, making the RAT attractive to threat actors.\nThe Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence team reported in late December 2022 on indications of threat actors using SparkRAT. However, we have not observed concrete evidence linking DragonSpark to the activity documented in the report by Microsoft.\nWe observed that the threat actor behind the DragonSpark attacks uses Golang malware that interprets embedded Golang source code at runtime as a technique for hindering static analysis and evading detection by static analysis mechanisms.

These C&amp;C servers are numerous and scattered all over the Internet, if the malware cannot reach one server it will try another. For this reason, network-based measures such as blocking the C&amp;C IPs is effective only in the short-term.’\nAccording to MalwareBytes, ‘Dridex uses an older tactic of infection by attaching a Word document that utilizes macros to install malware. However, once new versions of Microsoft Office came out and users generally updated, such a threat subsided because it was no longer simple to infect a user with this method.’\nIBM X-Force discovered ‘a new version of the Dridex banking Trojan that takes advantage of a code injection technique called AtomBombing to infect systems. AtomBombing is a technique for injecting malicious code into the ‘atom tables’ that almost all versions of Windows uses to store certain application data. It is a variation of typical code injection attacks that take advantage of input validation errors to insert and to execute malicious code in a legitimate process or application.

This may be explained by the group’s early reliance on Dynamic DNS domains for their command and control (C2) infrastructure, as well as their use of public RATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT for second-stage implants.\nIt wasn’t until June 2011 that Operation Dust Storm started to garner some notoriety from a series of attacks which leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, CVE-2011-1255, to gain a foothold into victim networks. In these attacks, a link to the exploit was sent via a spear phishing email from a purported Chinese student seeking advice or asking the target a question following a presentation.\nAs to other documented cases, the attacker started interacting with the infected machine within minutes of compromise to begin manual network and host enumeration.\nIn October 2011, the group attempted to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis at the time and phish the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi’s death on October 20, 2011. It appears that in addition to some US defense targets, this campaign was also directed at a Uyghur mailing list. This time, the group used a specially crafted malicious Windows Help (.hlp) file, which exploited CVE-2010-1885.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverDust StormCylance\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nSeems state-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2010\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\nOil and gas\nUyghurs\n\nObserved Countries\n\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nUSA\nEurope and Southeast Asia\n\nTools\n\nGh0st RAT\nMisdat\nMiS-Type\nPoison Ivy\nS-Type\n\nInformation\n\nwww.cylance.com/content/dam/cylance/pdfs/reports/Op_Dust_Storm_Report.pdf\nwww.symantec.com/connect/blogs/inside-back-door-attack\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0031/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n3c462561-ef5e-48ac-9138-38dc25d2afc4\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-22"},"DustSquad,-Golden-Falcon":{"slug":"DustSquad,-Golden-Falcon","filePath":"DustSquad, Golden Falcon.md","title":"DustSquad, Golden Falcon","links":["Russia","Defense","Government","Media","diplomats-and-dissidents","Afghanistan","Kazakhstan","Central-Asia","Harpoon","Octopus","Paperbug","Remote-Control-System"],"tags":[],"content":"DustSquad, Golden Falcon\nDescription\n(Kaspersky) For the last two years we have been monitoring a Russian-language cyberespionage actor that focuses on Central Asian users and diplomatic entities.

The threat actors later shifted to distribution via the Upatre downloader trojan. Dyre is also known as Dyreza, Dyzap, and Dyranges by the antivirus industry.\nDyre harvests credentials, primarily targeting online banking websites to perform Automated Clearing House (ACH) and wire fraud. The malware includes a modular architecture, man-in-the-browser functionality, and a backconnect server that allows threat actors to connect to a bank website through the victim’s computer. The man-in-the-browser functionality is based on a unique combination of redirects to fake websites controlled by the threat actor (‘web fakes’) and a dynamic web inject system that allows the threat actors to manipulate a financial institution’s website content. Similar to other banking trojans, Dyre hooks into the most popular web browsers to intercept traffic from a victim’s system, stealing information and manipulating website content before it is rendered by the browser.\nEarly Dyre versions were relatively primitive, sending command and control (C2) communications and stolen data via unencrypted HTTP. Recent iterations of Dyre use SSL to encrypt all C2 communications, as well as a custom encryption algorithm. Dyre also uses RSA cryptography to digitally sign configuration files and malware plugins to prevent tampering.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameDyreDyrezaDyzapDyranges\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBanking trojan\nInfo stealer\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nwww.secureworks.com/research/dyre-banking-trojan\nwww.blueliv.com/downloads/documentation/reports/Network_insights_of_Dyre_and_Dridex_Trojan_bankers.pdf\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2015/11/a-technical-look-at-dyreza/\nwww.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/05/04/dyre-hackers-stealing-millions-from-american-coporates\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/sin-ful-spiders-wizard-spider-and-lunar-spider-sharing-the-same-web/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0024/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.dyre\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:Dyre\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n1b27f8b4-dddf-4d58-b033-3772234bdd47\nLast Card Change\n2020-05-13"},"E-commerce,-Software-development-and-Video-game-development":{"slug":"E-commerce,-Software-development-and-Video-game-development","filePath":"E-commerce, Software development and Video game development.md","title":"E-commerce, Software development and Video game development","links":["E-commerce,-Software-development-and-Video-game-development"],"tags":[],"content":"E-commerce, Software development and Video game development\nA page for the sector E-commerce, Software development and Video game development."},"EAGLEDOOR":{"slug":"EAGLEDOOR","filePath":"EAGLEDOOR.md","title":"EAGLEDOOR","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"EAGLEDOOR\nDescription\n(Trend Micro) Earth Baxia also used a new backdoor named EAGLEDOOR, which supports multiple communication protocols for information gathering and payload delivery.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameEAGLEDOOR\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nInfo stealer\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nwww.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/i/earth-baxia-spear-phishing-and-geoserver-exploit.html\n\nOther Information\nUuid\na58df191-062c-4ff5-ad70-c5d66ac711cc\nLast Card Change\n2024-10-23"},"EFSPotato":{"slug":"EFSPotato","filePath":"EFSPotato.md","title":"EFSPotato","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"EFSPotato\nDescription\nNo description available yet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameEFSPotato\nCategory\nExploits\nOther Information\nUuid\n44255ddb-40a4-4246-961d-cf658a921c54\nLast Card Change\n2023-02-17"},"EHAGBPSL":{"slug":"EHAGBPSL","filePath":"EHAGBPSL.md","title":"EHAGBPSL","links":["JpgRun"],"tags":[],"content":"EHAGBPSL\nDescription\n(Symantec) Custom loader written in C++ - loaded by JpgRun loader.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameEHAGBPSLEHAGBPSL Loader\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nLoader\n\nInformation\n\nsymantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/china-apt-antlion-taiwan-financial-attacks\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n82178760-ca27-4caa-9bf9-c2a25468d386\nLast Card Change\n2022-02-04"},"EHDevel":{"slug":"EHDevel","filePath":"EHDevel.md","title":"EHDevel","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"EHDevel\nDescription\n(Bitdefender) The EHDevel toolkit is a specialized framework that has been used to gather field intelligence for years in different shapes and forms.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameEHDevel\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nInfo stealer\n\nInformation\n\nlabs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/ehdevel-the-story-of-a-continuously-improving-advanced-threat-creation-toolkit/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.ehdevel\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:ehdevel\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n80a6d6ab-9f7c-480c-add2-8735ff1eed15\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-23"},"EKANS":{"slug":"EKANS","filePath":"EKANS.md","title":"EKANS","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"EKANS\nDescription\n(Dragos) EKANS ransomware emerged in mid-December 2019, and Dragos published a private report to Dragos WorldView Threat Intelligence customers early January 2020.

RIPTIDE’s first communication with its C2 server fetches an encryption key, and the RC4 encryption key is used to encrypt all further communication.\nIn June 2014, Arbor Networks published an article describing the RIPTIDE backdoor and its C2 infrastructure in great depth. The blog highlighted that the backdoor was utilized in campaigns from March 2011 till May 2014.\nFollowing the release of the article, FireEye observed a distinct change in RIPTIDE’s protocols and strings.

Both Emissary and Elise are part of a malware group referred to as “LStudio”, which is based on the following debug strings found in Emissary and Elise samples.\nThere is code overlap between Emissary and Elise, specifically in the use of a common function to log debug messages to a file and a custom algorithm to decrypt the configuration file. The custom algorithm used by Emissary and Elise to decrypt their configurations use the “srand” function to set a seed value for the “rand” function, which the algorithm uses to generate a key. While the “rand” function is meant to generate random numbers, the malware author uses the “srand” function to seed the “rand” function with a static value. The static seed value causes the “rand” function to create the same values each time it is called and results in a static key to decrypt the configuration. The seed value is where the Emissary and Elise differ in their use of this algorithm, as Emissary uses a seed value of 1024 and Elise uses the seed value of 2012.\nWhile these two Trojans share code, we consider Emissary and Elise separate tools since their configuration structure, command handler and C2 communications channel differ. The Emissary Trojan delivered in this attack contains the components listed in Table 1. At a high level, Emissary has an initial loader DLL that extracts a configuration file and a second DLL containing Emissary’s functional code that it injects into Internet Explorer.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameEmissary\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/attack-on-french-diplomat-linked-to-operation-lotus-blossom/\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emissary-trojan-changelog-did-operation-lotus-blossom-cause-it-to-evolve/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0082/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emissary\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nff940eeb-a58a-41f6-93ca-8f61eb3abe46\nLast Card Change\n2021-04-24"},"Emotet":{"slug":"Emotet","filePath":"Emotet.md","title":"Emotet","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Emotet\nDescription\n(Malwarebytes) Emotet is a Trojan that is primarily spread through spam emails (malspam). The infection may arrive either via malicious script, macro-enabled document files, or malicious link. Emotet emails may contain familiar branding designed to look like a legitimate email. Emotet may try to persuade users to click the malicious files by using tempting language about “Your Invoice,” “Payment Details,” or possibly an upcoming shipment from well-known parcel companies.\nEmotet has gone through a few iterations. Early versions arrived as a malicious JavaScript file. Later versions evolved to use macro-enabled documents to retrieve the virus payload from command and control (C&amp;C) servers run by the attackers.\nEmotet uses a number of tricks to try and prevent detection and analysis. Notably, Emotet knows if it’s running inside a virtual machine (VM) and will lay dormant if it detects a sandbox environment, which is a tool cybersecurity researchers use to observe malware within a safe, controlled space.\nEmotet also uses C&amp;C servers to receive updates. This works in the same way as the operating system updates on your PC and can happen seamlessly and without any outward signs. This allows the attackers to install updated versions of the software, install additional malware such as other banking Trojans, or to act as a dumping ground for stolen information such as financial credentials, usernames and passwords, and email addresses.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameEmotetGeodoHeodo\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBanking

In October 2018, HSBC Malta reported receiving phishing emails that bore hallmarks of the subsequent EmpireMonkey attack against Bank of Valletta.\nThis group seems to be directly related to Carbanak, Anunak and/or FIN7.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverEmpireMonkey?CobaltGoblin?Anthropoid SpiderCrowdStrike\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\n\nFirst Seen\n2018\nObserved Sectors\n\nFinancial\n\nObserved Countries\n\nMalta\nWorldwide\n\nTools\n\nMedusaLocker\n\nOperations\n\n2021-03: Nine Entertainment warns ransomware recovery ‘will take time’\nwww.itnews.com.au/news/nine-entertainment-warns-ransomware-recovery-will-take-time-562755\n\nCounter Operations\n\n2020-01: 6 Suspects Arrested in Maltese Bank Hacking Heist\nwww.bankinfosecurity.com/6-suspects-arrested-in-maltese-bank-hacking-heist-a-13674\n\nInformation\n\nblueliv.com/resources/white-papers/Finance_whitepaper_ENG.pdf\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n6efb94b7-0f7d-4408-8541-a185a63320f2\nLast Card Change\n2021-04-26"},"EmpireProject":{"slug":"EmpireProject","filePath":"EmpireProject.md","title":"EmpireProject","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"EmpireProject\nDescription\nEmpire is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell2.0 Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent.

Infected emails had one of two subject lines: “The account” or “Settlement of delivery problem”.\nwww.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Dragonfly_Threat_Against_Western_Energy_Suppliers.pdf\n2013-06: Watering Hole Attacks using Lightsout\nIn June 2013, the attackers shifted their focus to watering hole attacks. They compromised a number of energy-related websites and injected an iframe into each of them. This iframe then redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. This in turn exploited either Java or Internet Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer.\n2013-09: Watering Hole Attacks using Hello\nIn September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing page for this kit contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed browser plugins. The victim is then redirected to a URL which in turn determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected.\n2013: Trojanized software\nThe most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of a number of legitimate software packages. Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the software bundles they had made available for download on their websites.\n2014-02: LightsOut EK Targets Energy Sector\nLate last year, the story broke that threat actors were targeting the energy sector with Remote Access Tools and Intelligence gathering malware.  It would seem that the attackers responsible for this threat are back for more.  This particular APT struck late February between 2/24-2/26.\nwww.zscaler.com/blogs/research/lightsout-ek-targets-energy-sector\n2015-12: Attack on Energy Companies in the Ukraine\nAccording to a statement posted this week on the official website of the Ukrainian security service SBU, Russian special services allegedly planted malware on the networks of several regional power companies. The malicious software is said to have been discovered by employees of the SBU.\nThe SBU said the attackers also flooded the targeted companies’ technical support phone lines. The agency removed the malware and launched an investigation.\nJust before Christmas, power outages were reported in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast region of Ukraine. The outages were blamed on outsiders who remotely tampered with automatic control systems. The power company responsible for the region also reported that its call center suffered a technical failure caused by a barrage of calls.\nssu.gov.ua/sbu/control/uk/publish/article\n2016: This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected and used by the group.

Group\nDescription\n(Ars Technica) Kaspersky researchers have documented 500 infections by Equation Group in at least 42 countries, with Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and Mali topping the list. Because of a self-destruct mechanism built into the malware, the researchers suspect that this is just a tiny percentage of the total; the actual number of victims likely reaches into the tens of thousands.\nA long list of almost superhuman technical feats illustrate Equation Group’s extraordinary skill, painstaking work, and unlimited resources. They include:\n• The use of virtual file systems, a feature also found in the highly sophisticated Regin malware. Recently published documents provided by Ed Snowden indicate that the NSA used Regin to infect the partly state-owned Belgian firm Belgacom.\n• The stashing of malicious files in multiple branches of an infected computer’s registry. By encrypting all malicious files and storing them in multiple branches of a computer’s Windows registry, the infection was impossible to detect using antivirus software.\n• Redirects that sent iPhone users to unique exploit Web pages. In addition, infected machines reporting to Equation Group command servers identified themselves as Macs, an indication that the group successfully compromised both iOS and OS X devices.\n• The use of more than 300 Internet domains and 100 servers to host a sprawling command and control infrastructure.\n• USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped networks, which are so sensitive that they aren’t connected to the Internet. Both Stuxnet and the related Flame malware platform also had the ability to bridge airgaps.\n• An unusual if not truly novel way of bypassing code-signing restrictions in modern versions of Windows, which require that all third-party software interfacing with the operating system kernel be digitally signed by a recognized certificate authority. To circumvent this restriction, Equation Group malware exploited a known vulnerability in an already signed driver for CloneCD to achieve kernel-level code execution.\nTaken together, the accomplishments led Kaspersky researchers to conclude that Equation Group is probably the most sophisticated computer attack group in the world, with technical skill and resources that rival the groups that developed Stuxnet and the Flame espionage malware in Operation Olympic Games.\nOther publicly exposed major APT activities from the NSA involve the wholesale worldwide spying from programs such as PRISM and, together with GCHQ, INCENSER, where various international Internet trunks were tapped.\nChina’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has accused the U.S. of breaking into Huawei’s servers, stealing critical data, and implanting backdoors since 2009, amid mounting geopolitical tensions between the two countries.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverEquation Groupreal nameTilded TeamCrySysPlatinum ColonySecureWorksAPT-C-40Qihoo 360\nCountry\n\nUSA\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored, believed to be tied to the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations unit\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\nSabotage and destruction\n\nFirst Seen\n2001\nObserved Sectors\n\nAerospace\nDefense\nEducation\nEnergy\nGovernment\nMedia\nOil and gas\nTelecommunications\nTransportation\nNanotechnology, Nuclear research, Islamic activists and scholars, and companies developing cryptographic technologies\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAfghanistan\nAlgeria\nAustria\nBangladesh\nBelgium\nBolivia\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana\nBrazil\nChile\nChina\nCyprus\nEcuador\nEgypt\nFinland\nFrance\nGabon\nGermany\nGreece\nHong Kong\nHungary\nIndia\nIran\nIraq\nIsrael\nItaly\nJapan\nJordan\nKazakhstan\nKenya\nLebanon\nLibya\nMalaysia\nMali\nMexico\nNetherlands\nNicaragua\nNigeria\nNorway\nPakistan\nPalestine\nPhilippines\nPoland\nQatar\nRomania\nRussia\nSaudi Arabia\nSingapore\nSomalia\nSouth Africa\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSudan\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nSyria\nThailand\nTurkey\nUAE\nUK\nUSA\nVenezuela\nYemen\n\nTools\n\nBvp47\nDanderSpritz\nDarkPulsar\nDOUBLEFANTASY\nDoubleFeature\nDoublePulsar\nDuqu\nEQUATIONDRUG\nEQUATIONLASER\nFANNY\nFlame\nGRAYFISH\nGROK\nLambert\nOddJob\nRegin\nTRIPLEFANTASY\nUNITEDRAKE\nmany others\n\nCounter Operations\n\n2016-08: Their arsenal of 0-day cyber weapons was stolen by an actor Shadow Brokers, who leaked a large section on the internet and tried to sell the rest afterward.\nMost notable among the dumps were 0-days such as ETERNALBLUE and ETERNALROMANCE that were used by other groups for the creation of infamous ransomware explosions such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\n\nInformation\n\nmedia.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08064459/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf\narstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)\nwww.electrospaces.net/2014/11/incenser-or-how-nsa-and-gchq-are.html\nwww.inversecos.com/2025/02/an-inside-look-at-nsa-equation-group.html\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0020/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n29bfd981-357b-4871-ba4b-ada033ba3217\nLast Card Change\n2025-03-02"},"Equatorial-Guinea":{"slug":"Equatorial-Guinea","filePath":"Equatorial Guinea.md","title":"Equatorial Guinea","links":["Equatorial-Guinea"],"tags":[],"content":"Equatorial Guinea\nA page for the country Equatorial Guinea."},"Erebus":{"slug":"Erebus","filePath":"Erebus.md","title":"Erebus","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Erebus\nDescription\n(Trend Micro) Erebus ransomware (RANSOM_EREBUS.A) first emerged last September 2016 being distributed by malvertisements (malicious advertisements).

One might note that file sharing over SMB is normally used only within local networks and that the SMB ports are typically blocked from the internet at the firewall. However, if an attacker has access to a vulnerable endpoint running SMB, the ability to run arbitrary code in kernel context from a remote location is a serious compromise.\nThis exploit was written to remotely install and launch an SMB backdoor. At the core of this exploit is a type confusion vulnerability leading to an attacker offset controlled arbitrary heap write.

This could suggest that the actors cast a wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture. Recently, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to pressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group’s shifting monetization methods—from point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in 2020—is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on post-compromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion.\nNotably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen, but we do not attribute TA505’s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably. Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is complicated by the actors’ use of criminal service providers. Like most financially motivated actors, FIN11 doesn’t operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group has used services that provide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting, code signing certificates, and private or semi-private malware. Outsourcing work to these criminal service providers likely enables FIN11 to increase the scale and sophistication of their

The group specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.\nFIN4 has targeted over 100 companies since at least mid-2013. All of the targeted organizations are either public companies or advisory firms that provide services to public companies (such as investor relations, legal, and investment banking firms). Over two-thirds of the targeted organizations are healthcare and pharmaceutical companies.

The group has been active since at least 2008 and has targeted the restaurant, gaming, and hotel industries. The group is made up of actors who likely speak Russian.\n(DarkReading) No 0days. No spear-phishing, either: The cybercriminal group tied to numerous payment card breaches including Goodwill and best known by its so-called “RawPOS” malware employed legitimate user credentials to access its targets’ networks.\nResearchers at FireEye here today shared their recent findings on this prolific and long-running cybercrime gang that has been the subject of multiple Visa security alerts to merchants. The RawPOS memory scraper malware has been infecting the lodging industry in epidemic proportions over the past year, and is considered one of the first memory scrapers to target point-of-sale systems.\nFireEye has dubbed the cybercrime gang FIN5. “One of the most unique things about FIN5 is that in every intrusion we responded to where FIN5 has been active, legitimate access was identified. They had valid user credentials to remotely log into the network,” said Barry Vengerik, principal threat analyst at FireEye. “No sexy zero-days, no remote exploits – not even spear-phishing. They had credentials from somewhere.”\nFIN5, which earlier this year was profiled by researchers at Trend Micro and has been in action since at least 2008, uses real credentials from the victim organization’s virtual private network, Remote Desktop Protocol, Citrix, or VNC. Vengerik says the attackers got those credentials via third parties associated with the victims’ POS systems.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverFIN5FireEye\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\n\nFirst Seen\n2008\nObserved Sectors\n\nGaming\nHospitality\n\nTools\n\nFLIPSIDE\npwdump\nRawPOS\nSDelete\nWindows Credentials Editor\n\nInformation\n\nwww.darkreading.com/analytics/prolific-cybercrime-gang-favors-legit-login-credentials/d/d-id/1322645\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0053/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n79996110-5bcb-4996-b3d8-0d778030f0dc\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-22"},"FIN6,-Skeleton-Spider":{"slug":"FIN6,-Skeleton-Spider","filePath":"FIN6, Skeleton Spider.md","title":"FIN6, Skeleton Spider","links":["Unknown","Chemical","Energy","Hospitality","Manufacturing","Retail","AbaddonPOS","Anchor","BlackPOS","CmdSQL","Cobalt-Strike","FlawedAmmyy","Grateful-POS","JSPSPY","LockerGoga","Magecart","Meterpreter","Mimikatz","More_eggs","Ryuk","SCRAPMINT","TerraStealer","Vawtrak","Windows-Credentials-Editor","Living-off-the-Land"],"tags":[],"content":"FIN6, Skeleton Spider\nDescription\nFIN6 is a cybercrime group that has stolen payment card data and sold it for profit on underground marketplaces.

FIN7 has moved away from weaponized Microsoft Office macros in order to evade detection. This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim.\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/fin7-phishing-lnk.html\n2017-07: Proofpoint researchers have uncovered that the threat actor commonly referred to as FIN7 has added a new Jscript backdoor called Bateleur and updated macros to its toolkit.\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fin7carbanak-threat-actor-unleashes-bateleur-jscript-backdoor\n2017: Leveraging Shim Databases for Persistence\nA unique aspect of the incidents was how the group installed the CARBANAK backdoor for persistent access. Mandiant identified that the group leveraged an application shim database to achieve persistence on systems in multiple environments. The shim injected a malicious in-memory patch into the Services Control Manager (“services.exe”) process, and then spawned a CARBANAK backdoor process.\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/fin7-shim-databases-persistence.html\n2017-06: Highly sophisticated fileless attack targeting restaurants across the US\nOn June 7, 2017, Morphisec Lab identified a new, highly sophisticated fileless attack targeting restaurants across the US.

Although it has been active over a large timespan, the group has mostly operated under the radar and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been covered by security researchers. It only recently attracted attention when a lure document was uploaded to VirusTotal and was brought to public knowledge by researchers on Twitter. Subsequently, one of its implants was analyzed by a Chinese intelligence firm. We have been able to expand some of the findings on the group and provide insights on additional variants. The malware dropped from the aforementioned document is dubbed MarkiRAT and is used to record keystrokes and clipboard content, provide file download and upload capabilities as well as the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s machine. We were able to trace the implant back to at least 2015, along with variants intended to hijack the execution of the Telegram and Chrome applications as a persistence method. Interestingly, some of the TTPs used by this threat actor are reminiscent of other groups operating in the domain of dissident surveillance. For example, it used the same C2 domains across its implants for years, which was witnessed in the activity of Domestic Kitten. In the same vein, the Telegram execution hijacking technique observed in this campaign by Ferocious Kitten was also observed being used by Rampant Kitten, as covered by Check Point.

The last of these stated in its report that Flame ‘is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found.’ Flame can spread to other systems over a local network (LAN). It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and network traffic. The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world.

Upon opening the RAR archive, an executable is started instead of a Microsoft Word document, resulting in infection.\nOnce inside the network, the GCMAN group uses legitimate and penetration testing tools such as Putty, VNC, and Meterpreter for lateral movement. Our investigation revealed an attack where the group then planted a cron script into bank’s server, sending financial transactions at the rate of $200 per minute.

The name was derived from multiple Microsoft Word documents used in the attacks. “Armagedon” (spelled incorrectly) was found in the “Last Saved By” and “Author” fields in multiple Microsoft Word documents. Although continuously developed, the campaign has been intermittently active at a small scale, and uses unsophisticated techniques. The attack timing suggests the campaign initially started due to Ukraine’s decision to accept the Ukraine-­‐European Union Association Agreement (AA). The agreement was designed to improve economic integrations between Ukraine and the European Union. Russian leaders publicly stated that they believed this move by Ukraine directly threatened Russia’s national security. Although initial steps to join the Association occurred in March 2012, the campaign didn’t start until much later (mid‐2013), as Ukraine and the EU started to more actively move towards the agreement.\nRussian actors began preparing for attacks in case Ukraine finalized the AA. The earliest identified modification timestamp of malware used in this campaign is June 26, 2013. A group of files with modification timestamps between August 12 and September 16, 2013 were used in the first wave of spear-phishing attacks, targeting government officials prior to the 10th Yalta Annual Meeting: “Changing Ukraine in a Changing World: Factors of Success.”\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverGamaredon GroupPalo AltoWinterflounderiDefensePrimitive BearCrowdStrikeBlueAlphaRecorded FutureBlue OtsoPWCIron TildenSecureWorksArmageddonSSUSectorC08ThreatReconCallistoNATO Association of CanadaShuckwormSymantecActiniumMicrosoftTrident UrsaPalo AltoDEV-0157MicrosoftUAC-0010CERT-UAAqua BlizzardMicrosoftUNC530?\nCountry\n\nRussia\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored, FSB Centre 18: Centre for Information Security (TsIB)\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2013\nObserved Sectors\n\nDefense\nGovernment\nLaw enforcement\nNGOs\ndiplomats and journalists\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAlbania\nAustria\nAustralia\nBangladesh\nBrazil\nCanada\nChile\nChina\nColombia\nCroatia\nDenmark\nGeorgia\nGermany\nGuatemala\nHonduras\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIran\nIsrael\nItaly\nJapan\nKazakhstan\nLatvia\nMalaysia\nNetherlands\nNigeria\nNorway\nPakistan\nPapua New Guinea\nPoland\nPortugal\nRomania\nRussia\nSouth Africa\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSweden\nTurkey\nUK\nUkraine\nUSA\nVietnam\n\nTools\n\nAversome infector\nBoneSpy\nDessertDown\nDilongTrash\nDinoTrain\nEvilGnome\nFRAUDROP\nGamaredon\nGammaDrop\nGammaLoad\nGammaSteel\nObfuBerry\nObfuMerry\nPlainGnome\nPowerPunch\nPteranodon\nQuietSieve\nRemcosRAT\nRMS\nResetter\nSUBTLE-PAWS\nUltraVNC\n\nOperations\n\n2019-04: The discovered attack appears to be designed to lure military personnel: it leverages a legit document of the “State of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” dated back in the 2nd April 2019.\nblog.yoroi.company/research/the-russian-shadow-in-eastern-europe-ukrainian-mod-campaign/\n2019-05: The Gamaredon attacks against Ukraine doesn’t seem to have stopped.

In mid-September 2023, during routine monitoring of adversary infrastructure, Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence unit identified a command and control (C&amp;C) server that was hosting several tools. Notably, none were custom-made. The entire toolset was based on publicly available open-source instruments used for pentesting purposes. After examining the toolset in more detail, it became clear that the tools were most likely associated with a threat actor executing one of the oldest attack methods: SQL injections.\nWhile delving deeper into the malicious infrastructure, Group-IB researchers identified the threat actor’s first targets, predominantly linked to the gambling industry. This prompted the Threat Intelligence unit to name the threat actor GambleForce (tracked under the name EagleStrike GambleForce in Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence Platform). Since it appeared in September 2023, GambleForce has targeted more than 20 websites (government, gambling, retail, and travel) in Australia, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, South Korea, Thailand, and Brazil.\nDespite using very basic attack methods, the threat actor has managed to successfully attack six companies in Australia (travel), Indonesia (travel, retail), the Philippines (government), and South Korea (gambling), which shows just how vulnerable many organizations are against rudimentary but clearly dangerous SQL injection attacks.\nIn some instances, the attackers stopped after performing reconnaissance. In other cases, they successfully extracted user databases containing logins and hashed passwords, along with lists of tables from accessible databases. Rather than looking for specific data, the threat actor attempts to exfiltrate any available piece of information within targeted databases, such as hashed and plain text user credentials. What the group does with the stolen data remains unknown so far.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverGambleForceGroup-IB\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2023\nObserved Sectors\n\nCasinos and Gambling\nGovernment\nHospitality\nRetail\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nBrazil\nChina\nIndia\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\nSouth Korea\nThailand\n\nTools\n\nCobalt Strike\nDirsearch\nredis-rogue-getshell\nsqlmap\nTinyproxy\n\nInformation\n\nwww.group-ib.com/blog/gambleforce-gang/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n4442e431-c4f1-4528-9b28-46ea479be9cc\nLast Card Change\n2024-01-16"},"GameOver-Zeus":{"slug":"GameOver-Zeus","filePath":"GameOver Zeus.md","title":"GameOver Zeus","links":["Zeus"],"tags":[],"content":"GameOver Zeus\nDescription\n(US-CERT) GOZ, which is often propagated through spam and phishing messages, is primarily used by cybercriminals to harvest banking information, such as login credentials, from a victim’s computer.

Centralized C2 servers are routinely tracked and blocked by the security community. GOZ, however, utilizes a P2P network of infected hosts to communicate and distribute data, and employs encryption to evade detection.

GandCrab variants caused a great deal of damage worldwide, including in South Korea.\nThe GandCrab ransomware shares an interesting history with AhnLab. Like many other examples of ransomware, GandCrab searches for any running or pre-installed anti‑malware program and when it finds one it interferes with its normal execution and shuts it down. However, when it came to AhnLab, GandCrab went the extra mile, specifically targeting the company and its anti-malware program V3 Lite by mentioning it in its code. It even revealed a vulnerability in the security program and made attempts to delete it entirely.\nTo effectively respond to and protect against GandCrab attacks, the AhnLab Security Analysis Team analysed GandCrab and all its different versions by thoroughly investigating the distributed code, encryption method, restoration method, and the evasive method it used to avoid behaviour-based detection. Each time a new attack feature targeting AhnLab and V3 was identified, the company’s product developers promptly addressed it to ensure maximum security.\nThe interesting conflict between AhnLab and the GandCrab ransomware was widely discussed in the IT security industry. However, the details that were revealed at the time were only the tip of the iceberg, with more details being kept private for reasons of confidentiality.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameGandCrabGrandCrab\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nRansomware\nBig Game Hunting\n\nInformation\n\nwww.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/01/behind-scenes-gandcrabs-operation/\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-being-distributed-via-malspam-disguised-as-receipts/\nasec.ahnlab.com/1145\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-operators-use-vidar-infostealer-as-a-forerunner/\nwww.vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/gandcrab-ransomware-evolution-analysis/\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-distributed-by-exploit-kits-appends-gdcb-extension/\nisc.sans.edu/diary/23417\ntccontre.blogspot.com/2018/11/re-gandcrab-downloader-theres-more-to.html\nblog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/gandcrab-compromised-sites.html\ncsecybsec.com/download/zlab/20181001_CSE_GandCrabv5.pdf\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/01/gandcrab-ransomware-distributed-by-rig-and-grandsoft-exploit-kits/\nwww.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/pay-no-more-universal-gandcrab-decryption-tool-released-for-free-no-more-ransom\nlabs.bitdefender.com/2018/02/gandcrab-ransomware-decryption-tool-available-for-free/\nlabs.bitdefender.com/2019/02/new-gandcrab-v5-1-decryptor-available-now/\nsensorstechforum.com/killswitch-file-now-available-gandcrab-v4-1-2-ransomware/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.gandcrab\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:GandCrab\n\nPlaybook\n\nwww.nomoreransom.org/uploads/GANDCRAB%20RANSOMWARE%20DECRYPTION%20TOOL%20(002).pdf\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n0b2b37bc-8665-4409-90a2-35a56aec7341\nLast Card Change\n2021-04-25"},"Gangnam-Industrial-Style":{"slug":"Gangnam-Industrial-Style","filePath":"Gangnam Industrial Style.md","title":"Gangnam Industrial Style","links":["Unknown","Engineering","Manufacturing","China","Ecuador","Germany","Indonesia","Japan","South-Korea","Thailand","Turkey","UK","LaZagne","MOVEit-Freely","NcFTPPut","Secure-FTP-Client","Separ","Living-off-the-Land"],"tags":[],"content":"Gangnam Industrial Style\nDescription\n(CyberX) Section 52, CyberX’s threat intelligence team, has uncovered an ongoing industrial cyberespionage campaign targeting hundreds of manufacturing and other industrial firms primarily located in South Korea.\nThe campaign steals passwords and documents which could be used in a number of ways, including stealing trade secrets and intellectual property, performing cyber reconnaissance for future attacks, and compromising industrial control networks for ransomware attacks.\nFor example, the attackers could be stealing proprietary information about industrial equipment designs so they can sell it to competitors and nation-states seeking to advance their competitive posture.\nAlso, credentials can provide attackers with remote RDP access to IoT/ICS networks, while plant schematics help adversaries understand plant layouts in order to facilitate attacks.

What makes Gelup different, however, is its obfuscation technique and UAC-bypassing function bymocking trusted directories (spoofing the file’s execution path in a trusted directory), abusing auto-elevated executables, and using the dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading technique.\nFirst, Gelup resolves most Windows application programming interfaces (APIs) by using the hash just before calling it —a common technique used by a lot of malware families.

While it is provided with fewer features, Ghambar appears better designed and with a cleaner code style.\nInterestingly, Ghambar is designed to leave as little footprint on the system as possible. When collecting screenshots, clipboard data, and intercepted keystrokes, it attempts to directly send the data to the C&amp;C without writing on disk.\nWhile executing a parallel keylogger, Ghambar is also able to receive instructions from the C&amp;C on additional tasks to execute. These tasks can be additional plugins to be downloaded and executed, generic tasks on the file system, or a number of predefined commands.\nGhambar is provided with a full­featured plugins system.

In this second report from the Information Warfare Monitor, we lay out the findings of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against Tibetan institutions.  The investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more. The investigation ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries. Up to 30% of the infected hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located at ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The Tibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our investigations began, were conclusively compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information.\n(UCAM) Attacks on the Dalai Lama’s Private Office\nThe OHHDL started to suspect it was under surveillance while setting up meetings be-tween His Holiness and foreign dignitaries. They sent an email invitation on behalf of His Holiness to a foreign diplomat, but before they could follow it up with a courtesy telephone call, the diplomat’s office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting.

These include plugins for getting screenshots, passwords, mails, and more. Without the plugins, Gorynych routines mostly focus on anti-analysis, information theft, and installations. In the Diamond Fox builder, the keylogger and PoS grabber functionalities are disabled by default. However, with Operation Black Atlas, these options were turned on, which proves that cybercriminals running this are intentionally targeting PoS systems.\nAfter downloading its plugins, Gorynych reports to its server via gate.php using HTTP POST. It uses its own user-agent that can be found in its configuration file. The parameters consist of system information used to profile the bot, mainly for identification in the Gorynych control panel. The posted information is encrypted using a simple XOR operation.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameGorynychGorynchDiamond FoxDiamondFoxCrystal\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nKeylogger\nInfo stealer\nCredential stealer\nBotnet\nDownloader\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-black-atlas-part-2-tools-and-malware-used-and-how-to-detect-them/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/03/diamond-fox-p1/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/04/diamond-fox-p2/\nblog.checkpoint.com/2017/05/10/diamondfox-modular-malware-one-stop-shop/\nblog.cylance.com/a-study-in-bots-diamondfox\nfr3d.hk/blog/diamondfox-bank-robbers-will-be-replaced\nwww.scmagazine.com/inside-diamondfox/article/578478/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.diamondfox\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:gorynich\n\nOther Information\nUuid\na6bf48fd-e90c-40e9-8d54-5b41f3acaf0d\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-28"},"GotoHTTP":{"slug":"GotoHTTP","filePath":"GotoHTTP.md","title":"GotoHTTP","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"GotoHTTP\nDescription\n(SentinelLabs) a cross-platform remote access tool that implements a wide array of features, such as establishing persistence, file transfer, and screen view.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameGotoHTTP\nCategory\nTools\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nwww.sentinelone.com/labs/dragonspark-attacks-evade-detection-with-sparkrat-and-golang-source-code-interpretation/\ngotohttp.com/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ndaf7c100-bcff-4b3d-8bfa-556715c13961\nLast Card Change\n2023-02-15"},"Government":{"slug":"Government","filePath":"Government.md","title":"Government","links":["Government"],"tags":[],"content":"Government\nA page for the sector Government."},"Govmomi":{"slug":"Govmomi","filePath":"Govmomi.md","title":"Govmomi","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Govmomi\nDescription\nA Go library for interacting with VMware vSphere APIs (ESXi and/or vCenter Server).\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameGovmomi\nCategory\nTools\nType\n\nReconnaissance\n\nInformation\n\ngithub.com/vmware/govmomi\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nb4ee4d33-b23f-4a7d-a2cc-64c6c393df83\nLast Card Change\n2023-11-29"},"GozNym":{"slug":"GozNym","filePath":"GozNym.md","title":"GozNym","links":["Nymaim","Gozi-ISFB"],"tags":[],"content":"GozNym\nDescription\n(IBM) IBM X-Force Research uncovered a Trojan hybrid spawned from the Nymaim and Gozi ISFB malware.

X-Force named this new hybrid GozNym.\nThe new GozNym hybrid takes the best of both the Nymaim and Gozi ISFB malware to create a powerful Trojan. From the Nymaim malware, it leverages the dropper’s stealth and persistence; the Gozi ISFB parts add the banking Trojan’s capabilities to facilitate fraud via infected Internet browsers.

This led to two main branches: one became known as Gozi v2, which was merged with Pony and became Vawtrak/Neverquest.\nThe other branch became known as Gozi ISFB, or ISFB in short. Webinject functionality was added to this version.\nThere is one panel which often was used in combination with ISFB: IAP. The panel’s login page comes with the title ‘Login - IAP’. The body contains ‘AUTHORIZATION’, ‘Name:’, ‘Password:’ and a single button ‘Sign in’ in a minimal design. Often, the panel is directly accessible by entering the C2 IP address in a browser. But there are ISFB versions which are not directly using IAP. The bot accesses a gate, which is called the ‘DreamBot’ gate.\nISFB often was protected by Rovnix. This led to a further complication in the naming scheme - many companies started to call ISFB Rovnix. Because the signatures started to look for Rovnix, other trojans protected by Rovnix (in particular ReactorBot and Rerdom) sometimes got wrongly labelled.\nIn April 2016 a combination of Gozi ISFB and Nymaim was detected. This breed became known as GozNym. The merge uses a shellcode-like version of Gozi ISFB, that needs Nymaim to run.

According to our research, the GreyEnergy actors deploy this backdoor mainly on two types of endpoints: servers with high uptime, and workstations used to control ICS environments.\nTo make communication with command and control (C&amp;C) servers stealthier, the malicious actors may deploy additional software on internal servers in the compromised network, so each server would act as a proxy. Such a proxy C&amp;C redirects requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&amp;C server on the internet. This way, it might be less suspicious to a defender who notices that multiple computers are “talking” to an internal server, rather than to a remote server. This technique can be also used by attackers to control the malware in different segments of a compromised network. A similar technique using internal servers as C&amp;C proxies was used by the Duqu 2.0 APT.\nIf an affected organization has public-facing web servers connected to an internal network, the attackers may deploy “backup” backdoors onto these servers.

The company has been criticized for selling these capabilities to authoritarian governments – an allegation it has consistently denied.\nWhen the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself suffering a damaging hack, the reported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was confirmed. With 400GB of internal data – including the once-secret list of customers, internal communications, and spyware source code – leaked online, Hacking Team was forced to request its customers to suspend all use of RCS, and was left facing an uncertain future.\nFollowing the hack, the security community has been keeping a close eye on the company’s efforts to get back on its feet. The first reports suggesting Hacking Team’s resumed operations came six months later – a new sample of Hacking Team’s Mac spyware was apparently in the wild. A year after the breach, an investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought changes to Hacking Team’s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking Team’s shareholding.

Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the spread of a destructive network worm. The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance and infiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and self-modifying destructive malware.\nWe are calling the actor behind the Olympic Destroyer attack – “Hades”. We have previously emphasized that Hades is different from other threat actors because the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception. Despite that, the attackers made serious mistakes, which helped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare attribution artefacts. The attackers behind Olympic Destroyer forged automatically generated signatures, known as Rich Header, to make it look like the malware was produced by Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima APT, an actor widely believed to be associated with North Korea. If this is new to the reader, we recommend a separate blog dedicated to the analysis of this forgery.\nSome of the TTPs and operational security used by Hades during the Olympic Destroyer attack bear a certain resemblance to Sofacy, APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sednit APT group activity. When it comes to false flags, mimicking TTPs is much harder than tampering with technical artefacts. It implies a deep knowledge of how the actor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation to these new TTPs. However, it is important to remember that Hades can be considered a master in the use of false flags: for now we assess that connection with low to moderate confidence.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverHadesKaspersky\nCountry\n\nRussia\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored, GRU\nMotivation\n\nSabotage and destruction\nFinancial crime\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\n\nObserved Countries\n\nRussia\nSouth Korea\nUkraine\nEurope\n\nTools\n\nBrave Prince\nGold Dragon\nOlympic Destroyer\nRunningRAT\n\nOperations\n\n2019-06: Hades, the actor behind Olympic Destroyer is still alive\nsecurelist.com/olympic-destroyer-is-still-alive/86169/\n2020-02: Operation “TrickyMouse”\nAttacks pretend to be from the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and deliver bait document containing the latest news regarding COVID-19.

Specifically, the only known infection vector for HammerDuke is to be downloaded and executed by CozyDuke onto a victim that has already been compromised by that toolset. This, together with HammerDuke’s simplistic backdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used by the Dukes group as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after CozyDuke performed the initial infection and stole any readily available information from them.\nHammerDuke is however interesting because it is written in .NET, and even more so because of its occasional use of Twitter as a C&amp;C communication channel. Some HammerDuke variants only contain a hardcoded C&amp;C server address from which they will retrieve commands, but other HammerDuke variants will first use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter account name based on the current date. If the account exists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from that account with links to image files that contain embedded commands for the toolset to execute.\nHammerDuke’s use of Twitter and crafted image files is reminiscent of other Duke toolsets. Both OnionDuke and MiniDuke also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names and then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image files.

Havex is estimated to have impacted thousands of infrastructure sites, a majority of which were located in Europe and the United States. Within the energy sector, Havex specifically targeted energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial equipment providers. Havex also impacted organizations in the aviation, defense, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries.\nOnce installed, Havex scanned the infected system to locate any Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or ICS devices on the network and sent the data back to command and control servers. To do so, the malware leveraged the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard, which is a universal communication protocol used by ICS components across many industries that facilitates open connectivity and vendor equipment interoperability. Havex used the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to connect to OPC servers inside of an ICS network and collect information such as CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.\nHavex was an intelligence-collection tool used for espionage and not for the disruption or destruction of industrial systems.

Based on these factors, the Hidden Lynx group would need to be a sizeable organization made up of between 50 and 100 individuals.\nMuch of the attack infrastructure and tools used during these campaigns originate from network infrastructure in China. The Hidden Lynx group makes regular use of zero-day exploits and has the ability to rework and customize exploits quickly. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of some other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). The Hidden Lynx group is an advanced persistent threat that has been in operation for at least four years and is breaking into some of the best-protected organizations in the world.

Our analysis of the two campaigns revealed that Sakabota is the predecessor to Hisoka, which was first observed in May 2019.\nDuring our analysis, we identified two different versions of Hisoka, specifically v0.8 and v0.9, both installed onto the network of two Kuwait organizations. Both versions contain command sets that allow the actor to control a compromised system. In both versions, the actor can communicate via a command and control (C2) channel that uses either HTTP or DNS tunneling. However, v0.9 also added the ability for an email-based C2 channel as well.\nThe email-based C2 communications capability added to Hisoka v0.9 relies on Exchange Web Services (EWS) to use a legitimate account on an Exchange server in order to allow the actor to communicate with Hisoka. The malware attempts to log into an Exchange server using supplied credentials and uses EWS to send and receive emails in order to establish communications between the target and the actor. However, the communications channel does not actually send and receive emails like other email-based C2 channels we have seen in the past. Instead, the channel relies on creating email drafts that the Hisoka malware and the actor will process in order to exchange data back and forth. By using email drafts as well as the same legitimate Exchange account to communicate, no emails will be detected outbound or received inbound.\nWithin two hours of gaining access to the system through Hisoka, the actor deployed two additional tools named Gon and EYE, whose names were based on the filenames Gon.sys and EYE.exe.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameHisoka\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nDownloader\n\nInformation\n\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-attacks-on-kuwait-shipping-and-transportation-organizations/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.hisoka\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf9fd0ba3-a910-4fda-b553-cf0c489d1e8a\nLast Card Change\n2021-04-24"},"Hodur":{"slug":"Hodur","filePath":"Hodur.md","title":"Hodur","links":["PlugX"],"tags":[],"content":"Hodur\nDescription\n(ESET) ESET researchers discovered a still-ongoing campaign using a previously undocumented Korplug (PlugX) variant, which they named Hodur due to its resemblance to the THOR variant previously documented by Unit 42 in 2020.

In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking  rojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted Indrik Spider millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware.\nIn August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by Indrik Spider, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.\nIndrik Spider appears to be a subgroup of TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen. In 2019, a subgroup of Indrik Spider split off into Doppel Spider.\nDridex has been observed to be distributed via Necurs (operated by Monty Spider) and Emotet (operated by Mummy Spider,

dangerous threat, since it is capable of controlling electricity substation switches and circuit breakers directly. To do so, it uses industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas).\nThese switches and circuit breakers are digital equivalents of analogue switches; technically they can be engineered to perform various functions. Thus, the potential impact may range from simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and more serious damage to equipment. The severity may also vary from one substation to another, as well. Needless to say, disruption of such systems can directly or indirectly affect the functioning of vital services.\nIndustroyer’s dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were designed to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and back then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their communication protocols were not designed with security in mind.

Additionally, the installation path very much reminds me of the early Dexter variants. It’s certainly likely that because these malware families’ code has been leaked online, the author used at least some of this code as a basis for JackPOS. While the malware technically has a command and control (C&amp;C) component to it, overall it’s quite limited and not nearly as robust as other examples seen in the past. I mentioned originally that I wanted to see if JackPOS brought something special to the table. I’m going to have to answer that question with a resounding ‘no’ in this particular case.

However, Unit 42 has recently discovered the actors have continued to evolve their custom malware arsenal. We’ve discovered a new malware family we’ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/\n2017-05: Attack on a company that provides a range of services to UK Government\nA number of sensitive documents were stolen by the attackers during the incident and we believe APT15 was targeting information related to UK government departments and military technology.\nDuring our analysis of the compromise, we identified new backdoors that now appear to be part of APT15’s toolset. The backdoor BS2005 – which has traditionally been used by the group – now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS.\nwww.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/march/apt15-is-alive-and-strong-an-analysis-of-royalcli-and-royaldns/\n2017: BackdoorDiplomacy: Upgrading from Quarian to Turian\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2021/06/10/backdoordiplomacy-upgrading-quarian-turian/\n2018-06: Operation “MirageFox”\nThe malware involved in this recent campaign, MirageFox, looks to be an upgraded version of a tool, a RAT believed to originate in 2012, known as Mirage.\nwww.intezer.com/miragefox-apt15-resurfaces-with-new-tools-based-on-old-ones/\n2019-03: The group continues to be active in 2019 – in March 2019, we detected a new Ketrican sample that has evolved from the 2018 Ketrican backdoor.

Group-IB researchers discovered that this malware, which was first registered on Virustotal in 2021, has almost exclusively been used against organizations in Thailand. At the time of writing, Group-IB researchers can confirm that Krasue was used against telecommunications companies, although it has likely been leveraged in attacks against organizations in other verticals as well.\nOwing to the fact that Thai companies were exclusively targeted, Group-IB has decided to call this RAT Krasue, a nod to the Thai name of a nocturnal native spirit known throughout Southeast Asian folklore. Krasue, who is said to hover in the air above the ground and is driven by extreme hunger, poses a severe risk to critical systems and sensitive data given that it is able to grant attackers remote access to the targeted network.

They first came to substantial media notice in 2013 with a series of coordinated attacks against an assortment of South Korean broadcasters and financial institutions using DarkSeoul, a wiper program that overwrites sections of the victims’ master boot record.\nIn November 2014, a large scale breach of Sony Pictures was attributed to Lazarus. The attack was notable due to its substantial penetration across Sony networks, the extensive amount of data exfiltrated and leaked, as well of use of a wiper in a possible attempt to erase forensic evidence. Attribution on the attacks was largely hazy, but the FBI released a statement tying the Sony breach to the earlier DarkSeoul attack, and officially attributed both incidents to North Korea.\nFast forward to May 2017 with the widespread outbreak of WannaCry, a piece of ransomware that used an SMB exploit as an attack vector. Attribution to North Korea rested largely on code reuse between WannaCry and previous North Korean attacks, but this was considered to be thin grounds given the common practice of tool sharing between regional threat groups. Western intelligence agencies released official statements to the public reaffirming the attribution, and on September 6, 2018, the US Department of Justice charged a North Korean national with involvement in both WannaCry and the Sony breach.\nLazarus Group has 3 subgroups:\n\nSubgroup: Andariel, Silent Chollima\nSubgroup: BeagleBoyz\nSubgroup: Bluenoroff, APT 38, Stardust Chollima\nSubgroup: Operation Contagious Interview\n\nThe following groups may be associated with the Lazarus Group: Covellite, Reaper, APT 37, Ricochet Chollima, ScarCruft, Wassonite and Moonstone Sleet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverLazarus GroupKasperskyLabyrinth ChollimaCrowdStrikeGroup 77TalosHastati GroupSecureWorksWhois Hacking TeamMcAfeeNewRomanic Cyber Army TeamMcAfeeZincMicrosoftHidden CobraTrend MicroApplewormSymantecAPT-C-26Qihoo 360ATK 3ThalesSectorA01ThreatReconITG03IBMTA404ProofpointDEV-0139MicrosoftGuardians of Peaceself givenGods Apostlesself givenGods Disciplesself givenUNC577MandiantUNC2970MandiantUNC4034MandiantUNC4736MandiantUNC4899MandiantDiamond SleetMicrosoftCitrine SleetMicrosoftJade SleetMicrosoftTraderTraitorCISAGleaming PiscesPalo AltoSlow PiscesPalo Alto\nCountry\n\nNorth Korea\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored, Bureau/Unit 211\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\nSabotage and destruction\nFinancial crime\n\nFirst Seen\n2007\nObserved Sectors\n\nAerospace\nDefense\nEnergy\nEngineering\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nMedia\nShipping and Logistics\nTechnology\nBitCoin exchanges\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nBangladesh\nBelgium\nBrazil\nCanada\nChile\nChina\nEcuador\nFrance\nGermany\nGuatemala\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIsrael\nJapan\nMexico\nNetherlands\nPhilippines\nPoland\nRussia\nSouth Africa\nSouth Korea\nTaiwan\nThailand\nUK\nUSA\nVietnam\nWorldwide (WannaCry)\n\nTools\n\n3proxy\n3Rat Client\nAndaratm\nAppleJeus\nARTFULPIE\nAryan\nATMDtrack\nAuditCred\nBADCALL\nBankshot\nBanSwift\nBISTROMATH\nBitsran\nBLINDINGCAN\nBlindToad\nBookcode\nBootWreck\nBottomLoader\nBrambul\nBTC Changer\nBUFFETLINE\nCastov\nCheeseTray\nCleanToad\nClientTraficForwarder\nCOLDCAT\nCollectionRAT\nConcealment Troy\nContopee\nCookieTime\nDacls RAT\nDarkComet\nDAVESHELL\nDBLL Dropper\nDeltaCharlie\nDestover\nDLRAT\nDozer\nDoublePulsar\nDRATzarus\nDtrack\nDuuzer\nDyePack\nELECTRICFISH\nEternalBlue\nFALLCHILL\nFimlis\nFudModule\nGh0st RAT\nGopuram\nHARDRAIN\nHawup\nHermes\nHLOADER\nHOOKSHOT\nHOPLIGHT\nHotelAlfa\nHOTCROISSANT\nHotwax\nHtDnDownLoader\nHttp Dr0pper\nHTTP Troy\nICONICSTEALER\nJoanap\nJokra\nKANDYKORN\nKEYMARBLE\nKillDisk\nKoredos\nLazarus\nLightlessCan\nLIGHTSHIFT\nLIGHTSHOW\nMagicRAT\nMATA\nMimikatz\nMydoom\nNachoCheese\nNestEgg\nNickelLoader\nNineRAT\nNukeSped\nOpBlockBuster\nPEBBLEDASH\nPhanDoor\nPLANKWALK\nPlink\nPondRAT\nPOOLRAT\nPowerBrace\nPowerRatankba\nPowerShell RAT\nPowerSpritz\nPowerTask\nProcDump\nProxysvc\nPSLogger\nQuickcafe\nQuiteRAT\nRatankba\nRatankbaPOS\nRawDisk\nRecon\nRedShawl\nRifdoor\nRising Sun\nRomeos\nRomeoAlfa\nRomeoBravo\nRomeoCharlie\nRomeoDelta\nRomeoEcho\nRomeoFoxtrot\nRomeoGolf\nRomeoHotel\nRomeoMike\nRomeoNovember\nRomeoWhiskey\nRustBucket\nScout\nSHARPKNOT\nSheepRAT\nSIDESHOW\nSierraAlfa\nSierraCharlie\nSIGFLIP\nSLICKSHOES\nSmallTiger\nStunnel\nSUDDENICON\nSUGARLOADER\nTAINTEDSCRIBE\nTAXHAUL\nTdrop\nTdrop2\nTFlower\nThreatNeedle\nTigerRAT\nTOUCHKEY\nTOUCHMOVE\nTOUCHSHIFT\nTOUCHSHOT\nTroy\nTYPEFRAME\nValeforBeta\nVEILEDSIGNAL\nVHD\nVolgmer\nVSingle\nVyveva\nWannaCry\nWbBot\nWinorDLL64\nWolfRAT\nWormhole\nYamaBot\nYort\nLiving off the Land\n\nOperations\n\n2007: Operation “Flame”\nTarget: South Korean government.\nMethod: Disruption and sabotage.\n2009-07: Operation “Troy”\nNorth Korean hackers are suspected of launching a cyber-attack on some of the most important government offices in the US and South Korea in recent days, including the White House, the Pentagon, the New York Stock Exchange and the presidential Blue House in Seoul.\nThe attack took out some of South Korea’s most important websites, including those of the Blue House, the defense ministry, the national assembly, Shinhan bank, Korea Exchange bank and the top internet portal Naver.\nTarget: Government, financial and media institutions in South Korea and USA.\nMethod: DdoS attacks.\nwww.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/08/south-korea-cyber-attack\n2011-03: Attack on South Korean banks and media\nRecent Distributed Denial of Service (DdoS) attacks on a number South Korean websites have been in news for the past week. The threat responsible for carrying out these attacks is Trojan.Koredos.\nTarget: South Korean organizations.\nMethod: DdoS attacks and destruction of infected machines.\nwww.symantec.com/connect/blogs/trojankoredos-comes-unwelcomed-surprise\n2013-03: Operation “Ten Days of Rain” / ”DarkSeoul”\nComputer networks running three major South Korean banks and the country’s two largest broadcasters were paralyzed Wednesday in attacks that some experts suspected originated in North Korea, which has consistently threatened to cripple its far richer neighbor.\nThe attacks, which left many South Koreans unable to withdraw money from A.T.M.’s and news broadcasting crews staring at blank computer screens, came as the North’s official Korean Central News Agency quoted the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as threatening to destroy government installations in the South, along with American bases in the Pacific.\nTarget: Three broadcasting stations and a bank in South Korea.\nMethod: Infecting with viruses, stealing and wiping information.\nwww.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html\n2013-05: South Korean Financial Companies Targeted by Castov\nIn the past few months we have been actively monitoring an exploit kit, called Gongda, which is mainly targeting South Korea. Interestingly, we have come across a piece of malware, known as Castov, being delivered by this exploit kit that targets specific South Korean financial companies and their customers. The cybercriminals in this case have done their research on the South Korean online financial landscape.\nwww.symantec.com/connect/blogs/south-korean-financial-companies-targeted-castov\n2013-06: DarkSeoul Cyberattacks Against South Korea Continue on Anniversary of Korean War\nYesterday, June 25, the Korean peninsula observed a series of cyberattacks coinciding with the 63rd anniversary of the start of the Korean War. While multiple attacks were conducted by multiple perpetrators, one of the distributed denial-of-service (DdoS) attacks observed yesterday against South Korean government websites can be directly linked to the DarkSeoul gang and Trojan.Castov.\nwww.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war\n2014-11: Operation “Blockbuster”: Breach of Sony Pictures Entertainment\nThe attack on Sony Pictures became public knowledge on November 24, 2014, when Sony employees turned on their computers to be greeted with the sight of a neon red skeleton and the words “Hacked by GOP”, which stood for “Guardians of the Peace”. The message also threatened to release data later that day if an unspecified request was not met. Over the following weeks, huge swathes of information stolen from Sony were released, including: personal information about employees and their families; email correspondence between employees at the company; information about company salaries, unreleased Sony films, and other information.\nTarget: Sony Pictures Entertainment (released the “Interview” movie, ridiculing the North Korean leader).\nMethod: Infecting with malware, stealing and wiping data of the company’s employees, correspondence, copies of unreleased films.\nwww.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/the-hack-of-sony-pictures-what-you-need-to-know\nwww.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf\n2015-06: Using the Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence platform, we identified several samples of malicious code with behavior similar to the aforementioned Operation Troy campaign dating back to June 2015, over two years after the original attacks in South Korea.

The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be funneled between a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designation system, which allows either side to initiate a funneling session. The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and password.

Instead, the group often simply emails a Winnti installer to potential victims, relying on basic social engineering tactics to convince recipients to run the attached malware.

The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits. Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and brute-force/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems.\n(Dragos) Analysis of Raspite tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. Raspite targeting includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time.\nRaspite leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks. Raspite uses the same methodology as Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0 and Allanite in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to Raspite –controlled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverLeafminerSymantecRaspiteDragosFlash KittenCrowdStrike\nCountry\n\nIran\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\nFinancial\nGovernment\nTransportation\n\nObserved Countries\n\nIsrael\nKuwait\nLebanon\nUSA\nEurope and East Asia\n\nTools\n\nImecab\nLaZagne\nMimikatz\nPhpSpy\nSorgu\n\nInformation\n\nwww.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/leafminer-espionage-middle-east\ndragos.com/resource/raspite/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0077/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nbde56229-34b6-4a33-b6c0-358d41416ee3\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-22"},"Leash":{"slug":"Leash","filePath":"Leash.md","title":"Leash","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Leash\nDescription\n(Palo Alto) The Magic Hound campaign was also discovered deploying an IRC Bot, which we have named MagicHound.Leash.

The campaign also targeted an email address possibly belonging to a freelance journalist based in Cambodia who covers Cambodian politics, human rights, and Chinese development. We believe both attacks used the same infrastructure as a reported campaign by Chinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope (also known as Leviathan), which targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to their July 2018 elections. Crucially, TEMP.Periscope’s interest in the U.K. engineering company they targeted dates back to attempted intrusions in May 2017.\nwww.recordedfuture.com/chinese-threat-actor-tempperiscope/\n2017: The current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017. Like multiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed conducting operations with a revised toolkit. Known targets of this group have been involved in the maritime industry, as well as engineering-focused entities, and include research institutes, academic organizations, and private firms in the United States.\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries.html\n2018-07: Targeting Cambodia Ahead of July 2018 Elections\nFireEye has examined a range of TEMP.Periscope activity revealing extensive interest in Cambodia’s politics, with active compromises of multiple Cambodian entities related to the country’s electoral system.

LightBasin’s focus on Linux and Solaris systems is likely due to the combination of critical telecommunications infrastructure running on those operating systems, in addition to the comparatively lax security measures and monitoring solutions on Linux/Solaris systems that are typically in place on Windows operating systems within an organization.\nLightBasin managed to initially compromise one of the telecommunication companies in a recent CrowdStrike Services investigation by leveraging external DNS (eDNS) servers — which are part of the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network and play a role in roaming between different mobile operators — to connect directly to and from other compromised telecommunication companies’ GPRS networks via SSH and through previously established implants.

This makes it more difficult for defenders to detect attacks and researchers to identify the attackers behind the campaign. In the attacks we’re seeing, there are binaries supplied by the victim’s operating system that are normally used for legitimate purposes, but in these cases, are being abused by the attackers.\n(LOLBAS Project) The goal of the LOLBAS project is to document every binary, script, and library that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.\nA LOLBin/Lib/Script must:\n• Be a Microsoft-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Microsoft.\n• Have extra ‘unexpected’ functionality.

Instead, the binary only goes as far as encoding the RSA public key that is used in its later stages for file encryption. It’s possible to speculate that the attackers may have already been fully aware of the target companies’ security measures, and were therefore confident that their malware would not be intercepted even without any obfuscation.\nAnother interesting fact is that the malware uses open-source Boost libraries for its filesystem, and inter-process communication and Crypto++ (Cryptopp) for file encryption. One of the advantages of using these libraries is easier development and implementation since developers only need to work with wrapper functions instead of calling individual native APIs to achieve the same goal. And since this utilizes a higher level of programming, statically and dynamically analysing the application without source code is more complicated than just reading a straight sequence of Windows APIs. However, since they do not use standard libraries, they need to be manually linked and the functions need to be physically added to the final binary, which results a larger file size than usual.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameLockerGoga\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nRansomware\nBig Game Hunting\n\nInformation\n\nwww.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/lockergoga-ransomeware-targeting-critical-infrastructure.html\nwww.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-lockergoga-ransomware\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/pick-six-intercepting-a-fin6-intrusion.html\nwww.abuse.io/lockergoga.txt\ndoublepulsar.com/how-lockergoga-took-down-hydro-ransomware-used-in-targeted-attacks-aimed-at-big-business-c666551f5880\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-lockergoga-ransomware-allegedly-used-in-altran-attack/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0372/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.lockergoga\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:LockerGoga\n\nPlaybook\n\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitdefender-releases-free-decryptor-for-lockergoga-ransomware/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n8cdd2a40-7ddd-4caf-b7d0-94af5984a979\nLast Card Change\n2022-11-18"},"Locky":{"slug":"Locky","filePath":"Locky.md","title":"Locky","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Locky\nDescription\nLocky is a high profile ransomware family that first appeared in early 2016 and was observed being active until end of 2017.

It has used a range of back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker.\nLonghorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally.\nLonghorn’s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals—all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions.\nFor C&amp;C servers, Longhorn typically configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target.

The attackers use very simple malware, which required little development time or skills, in conjunction with freely available Web hosting, to implement a highly effective attack. It is a case of the attackers obtaining a maximum return on their investment. The attack shows how an intelligent attacker does not need to be particularly technically skilled in order to steal the information they are after. The attack begins, as is often the case, with an email sent to the victim. A malicious document is attached to the email, which, when loaded, activates the malware.  The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the victim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an academic claimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP).\nThe vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In other cases, the attackers used more of a ‘shotgun’ like approach, copying every file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address range based in Sichuan province, China. The remaining two were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that the IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous.\nThe attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and focused, employing the minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero day exploits or complicated threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering and lax security measures on the part of the victims.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverLucky CatSymantec\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2011\nObserved Sectors\n\nAerospace\nDefense\nEngineering\nShipping and Logistics\nTibetan activists\n\nObserved Countries\n\nIndia\nJapan\nMalaysia\nTibet\n\nTools\n\nComfoo\nLucky Cat\nSojax\nWMI Ghost\n\nInformation\n\nwww.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the_luckycat_hackers.pdf\nwww.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_luckycat_redux.pdf\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n5472bd65-7a33-4ae8-9918-79509d45f2df\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-14"},"Luminosity-RAT":{"slug":"Luminosity-RAT","filePath":"Luminosity RAT.md","title":"Luminosity RAT","links":["Zeus"],"tags":[],"content":"Luminosity RAT\nDescription\n(Proofpoint) The stated purpose of LuminosityLink is ostensibly benign: ‘LuminosityLink allows system administrators to manage a large amount of computers concurrently.

Typically, they will handpick a set of targets that in turn are handled with almost surgical precision, with infection vectors, malicious implants and payloads being tailored to the victims’ identities or environment. It’s not often we observe a large-scale attack conducted by actors fitting this profile, usually due to such attacks being noisy, and thus putting the underlying operation at risk of being compromised by security products or researchers.\nWe recently came across unusual APT activity that exhibits the latter trait – it was detected in high volumes, albeit most likely aimed at a few targets of interest. This large-scale and highly active campaign was observed in South East Asia and dates back to at least October 2020, with the most recent attacks seen around the time of writing. Most of the early sightings were in Myanmar, but it now appears the attackers are much more active in the Philippines, where there are more than 10 times as many known targets.\nFurther analysis revealed that the underlying actor, which we dubbed LuminousMoth, shows an affinity to the Mustang Panda, Bronze President (HoneyMyte) group. This is evident in both network infrastructure connections, and the usage of similar TTPs to deploy the Cobalt Strike Beacon as a payload. In fact, our colleagues at ESET and Avast recently assessed that HoneyMyte was active in the same region.

It all started when we became aware of a number of incidents at several Russian banks that had resulted in the theft of large sums of money from customers. To steal the money, the unknown criminals used a hidden malicious program that was able to interact automatically with the financial institution’s remote banking service (RBS) software; replacing bank details in payment orders generated by an accountant at the attacked organization, or even generating such orders by itself.\nIn 2016, it is hard to imagine banking software that does not demand some form of additional authentication, but things were different back in 2011. In most cases, the attackers only had to infect the computer on which the RBS software was installed in order to start stealing the cash. Russia’s banking system, like those of many other countries, was unprepared for such attacks, and cybercriminals were quick to exploit the security gap.\nSo we decided to take a closer look at the malware. The first attempts to understand how the program worked gave our analysts nothing. Regardless of whether it was launched on a virtual or a real machine, it behaved in the same way: it didn’t do anything. This is how the program, and later the group behind it, got its name. To “lurk” means to hide, generally with the intention of ambush.\nWe were soon able to help investigate another incident involving Lurk. This time we got a chance to explore the image of the attacked computer. There, in addition to the familiar malicious program, we found a .dll file with which the main executable file could interact. This was our first piece of evidence that Lurk had a modular structure.\nLater discoveries suggest that, in 2011, Lurk was still at an early stage of development.

The POST requests contain a GUID derived from the system’s volume serial number, a TeamViewer unique id and password, username, computer name, operating system version, and beacon interval. MINEBRIDGE can also communicate with a C2 server by sending TeamViewer chat messages using a custom window procedure hook.

In January 2015, the German news outlet Der Spiegel released previously unpublished documents on cyber espionage conducted by American intelligence agencies.50 One of them revealed an NSA tactic labeled “fourth party collection,” which is the practice of breaking into the command and control infrastructure of foreign-state-sponsored hackers to look over their shoulders. The presentation describes a real-life example of acquiring intelligence and stealing victims from a group code-named VOYEUR by the NSA, otherwise known as Magic Kitten.\nMagic Kitten appears to be among the oldest and most elaborate threat actors originating in Iran. It is also distinct from other groups because of its apparent relationship with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence rather than the IRGC. However, Magic Kitten’s activities mirror those of other groups, with the primary targets being Iranians inside Iran and Tehran’s regional rivals. The earliest observed samples of Magic Kitten’s custom malware agent dates to 2007, well before other known malware apparently originated, and the threat actor continues to be active.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverMagic KittenCrowdStrikeVOYEURNSA\nCountry\n\nIran\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2007\nObserved Countries\n\nGermany\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIraq\nLebanon\nNetherlands\nPakistan\nQatar\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nThailand\nUAE\n\nInformation\n\ncarnegieendowment.org/2018/01/04/iran-s-cyber-ecosystem-who-are-threat-actors-pub-75140\nirancybernews.org/magic-kitten-the-oldest-kitten/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ndb2c5058-0f53-4aab-ac65-95f1504c9892\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-31"},"MagicRAT":{"slug":"MagicRAT","filePath":"MagicRAT.md","title":"MagicRAT","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"MagicRAT\nDescription\n(Talos) MagicRAT is programmed in C++ programming language and uses the Qt Framework by statically linking it to the RAT on 32- and 64-bit versions.

During the investigation, the Nocturnus Team uncovered a previously undocumented and stealthy RAT (Remote Access Trojan) dubbed ShellClient which was employed as the primary espionage tool.\nThe Nocturnus Team found evidence that the ShellClient RAT has been under ongoing development since at least 2018, with several iterations that introduced new functionalities, while it evaded antivirus tools and managed to remain undetected and publicly unknown.\nAssessments as to the identity of the operators and authors of ShellClient resulted in the identification of a new Iranian threat actor dubbed MalKamak that has operated since at least 2018 and remained publicly unknown thus far. In addition, our research points out possible connections to other Iranian state-sponsored APT threat actors such as Chafer, APT 39 and Agrius APT.

The malicious program is a platform used to deploy extra (add-on) malicious modules, store them stealthily and thus add new capabilities for the threat actors. The attack unfolds in several stages, as described below:\n\nThe exploit is activated, and an appropriate (32-bit or 64-bit) version of the malicious program is installed on the victim computer, depending on the type of operating system installed on it. To do this installation, malicious code is injected into the system process ‘explorer.exe’ rather than into its memory. The malicious program has a modular structure: its main body is stored in the registry, while its add-on modules are downloaded following the instruction arriving from the C&amp;C server. DLL hijacking (use of a modified system library) is used to ensure that the main module is launched each time the system is rebooted.\nThe main module of the malicious program receives an instruction to download and launch add-on modules, which opens new capabilities for the threat actors.\nThe malicious add-on modules provide opportunities to control the victim system, take screenshots of windows and intercept information entered from the keyboard. We have seen them in other cyber-espionage campaigns as well.\nThe threat actors use PowerSploit, a modified set of PowerShell scripts, and various utilities to steal files and passwords found on the victim computer.\n\nThe cybercriminals were primarily interested in .doc, .ppt, .xls, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf, .txt and .rtf files on the victim computers. The harvested files were packed into a password-protected archive and sent to the threat actors’ server.\nOverall, the tactics, techniques and procedures that the cybercriminals used in their attacks can hardly be considered complicated or expensive. However, there were a few things that caught our eye:\n• The payload (at least one of the modules) is delivered using some simple steganography. Within traffic, it looks like a download of a regular JPEG image; however, the encrypted payload is loaded immediately after the image data. Microcin searches for a special ‘ABCD’ label in such a file; it is followed by a special structure, after which the payload comes, to be decrypted by Microcin. This way, new, platform-independent code and/or PE files can be delivered.\n• If the Microcin installer detects the processes of some anti-malware programs running in the system, then, during installation, it skips the step of injecting into ‘explorer.exe’, and the modified system library used for establishing the malicious program within the system is placed into the folder %WINDIR%; to do this, the system app ‘wusa.exe’ is used with the parameter “/extract” (on operating systems with UAC).\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameMicrocinMikroceen\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nInfo

Among the targeted subjects were several important companies in the telecommunications and gas industries, and governmental entities.\nMoreover, we connect the dots between the latest campaign and three previously published reports: Kaspersky’s Microcin against Russian military personnel, Palo Alto Networks’ BYEBY against the Belarussian government and Checkpoint’s Vicious Panda against the Mongolian public sector. Also, we discuss other malware that was typically a part of the attacker’s toolset together with the RAT. We chose the name Mikroceen to cover all instances of the RAT, in acknowledgement of Kaspersky’s initial report on the family.

Additionally, a specific loader is often associated with the MiniDuke toolset and is referred to as the “MiniDuke loader”.\nWhile the loader has often been used together with other MiniDuke components, it has also commonly been used in conjunction with CosmicDuke and PinchDuke. In fact, the oldest samples of the loader that we have found were used with PinchDuke. To avoid confusion however, we have decided to continue referring to the loader as the “MiniDuke loader”.\nTwo details about MiniDuke components are worth noting. Firstly, some of the MiniDuke components were written in Assembly language. While many malware were written in Assembly during the ‘old days‘ of curiosity-driven virus writing, it has since become a rarity. Secondly, some of the MiniDuke components do not contain a hardcoded C&amp;C server address, but instead obtain the address of a current C&amp;C server via Twitter. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the address of a C&amp;C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C&amp;C server responds) is a feature also found in OnionDuke, CozyDuke, and HammerDuke.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameMiniDuke\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nDownloader\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nblog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18122307/F-Secure_Dukes_Whitepaper.pdf\nsecurelist.com/the-miniduke-mystery-pdf-0-day-government-spy-assembler-0x29a-micro-backdoor/31112/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0051/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.miniduke\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:miniduke\n\nOther Information\nUuid\na5e00272-5532-4ea6-a45c-4fe8231772a4\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-22"},"MiniWebCmdShell":{"slug":"MiniWebCmdShell","filePath":"MiniWebCmdShell.md","title":"MiniWebCmdShell","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"MiniWebCmdShell\nDescription\nNo description available yet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameMiniWebCmdShell\nCategory\nTools\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\ngithub.com/xl7dev/WebShell/blob/master/Php/ava%20Server%20Faces%20MiniWebCmdShell%200.2%20by%20HeartLESS.php\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n3117eb1e-e06b-4dbf-82b1-772d8e078645\nLast Card Change\n2022-01-25"},"Mining":{"slug":"Mining","filePath":"Mining.md","title":"Mining","links":["Mining"],"tags":[],"content":"Mining\nA page for the sector Mining."},"Ministry-of-Unification,-Sejong-Institute-and-Korea-Institute-for-Defense-Analyses":{"slug":"Ministry-of-Unification,-Sejong-Institute-and-Korea-Institute-for-Defense-Analyses","filePath":"Ministry of Unification, Sejong Institute and Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.md","title":"Ministry of Unification, Sejong Institute and Korea Institute for Defense Analyses","links":["Ministry-of-Unification,-Sejong-Institute-and-Korea-Institute-for-Defense-Analyses"],"tags":[],"content":"Ministry of Unification, Sejong Institute and Korea Institute for Defense Analyses\nA page for the sector Ministry of Unification, Sejong Institute and Korea Institute for Defense Analyses."},"Minzen":{"slug":"Minzen","filePath":"Minzen.md","title":"Minzen","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Minzen\nDescription\n(Palo Alto) Minzen is a modular malware that has both 32-bit and 64-bit components in its resource section or configuration data in its body.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameMinzenXXMMWaliShadowWaliShadowWalker\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nLoader\n\nInformation\n\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-tick-group-continues-attacks/\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/redbaldknight-bronze-butler-daserf-backdoor-now-using-steganography/\njsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2019/pdf/JSAC2019_8_nakatsuru_en.pdf\nwww.secureworks.com/research/bronze-butler-targets-japanese-businesses\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.xxmm\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:Minzen\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n6556f750-eaad-42bc-ba0f-b9895199f159\nLast Card Change\n2020-05-14"},"MirageFox":{"slug":"MirageFox","filePath":"MirageFox.md","title":"MirageFox","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"MirageFox\nDescription\nMirageFox is a remote access tool used against Windows systems.

Security researchers subsequently linked these attacks to a broader, yearlong campaign that targeted not just Israelis but Palestinians as well — and as discovered later, even the U.S. and UK governments.\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html\n2013-06: We observed several attacks in June and July 2013 against targets in the Middle East and the U.S. that dropped a PIVY payload that connected to command-and-control (CnC) infrastructure used by the Molerats attackers.\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html\n2014-04: Between 29 April and 27 May, FireEye Labs identified several new Molerats attacks targeting at least one major U.S. financial institution and multiple, European government organizations.\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/06/molerats-here-for-spring.html\n2014 Summer: Attacks against Israeli &amp; Palestinian interests\nThe decoy documents and filenames used in the attacks suggest the intended targets include organizations with political interests or influence in Israel and Palestine.\npwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html\n2014: Operation “Moonlight”\nVectra Threat Labs researchers have uncovered the activities of a group of individuals currently engaged in targeted attacks against entities in the Middle East.

Dozens of targets may receive the exact same message. The email message and the lure document are written in Hebrew, Arabic or English –depending on the target audience. Targeted sectors include governmental and diplomatic institutions, including embassies; companies from the aerospace and defense Industries; financial institutions; journalists; software developers.

However, the attacks against targets in the Middle East (except Israel) were renewed in less than 20 days. In the beginning of April 2016, we found evidence that the attacks against Israel have been renewed as well. Based on the type of targets, on Gaza being the source of the attacks, and on the type of information the attackers are after –we estimate with medium-high certainty that the Hamas terrorist organization is behind these attacks.\nwww.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Operation-DustySky2_-6.2016_TLP_White.pdf\nkc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/PRODUCT_DOCUMENTATION/26000/PD26760/en_US/McAfee_Labs_Threat_Advisory_GazaCybergang.pdf\n2016-11: PwC analysts have been tracking the same malware campaign, which has seen a noticeable spike since at least April 2016. The attackers have targeted Arabic news websites, political figures and other targets that possess influence in the Palestinian territories and other neighbouring Arab countries.\nOur investigation began by  nalyzing around 20 executable files associated with the attacks. Several of these files opened decoy documents and audio files, which were exclusively in Arabic-language.\npwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/11/molerats-theres-more-to-the-naked-eye.html\n2017 Mid: New targets, use of MS Access Macros and CVE 2017-0199, and possible mobile espionage\nOne of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.\nAnother interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated.\nsecurelist.com/gaza-cybergang-updated-2017-activity/82765/\n2017-09: Operation “TopHat”\nIn recent months, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 observed a wave of attacks leveraging popular third-party services Google+, Pastebin, and bit.ly.\nThe attacks we found within the TopHat campaign began in early September 2017. In a few instances, original filenames of the identified samples were written in Arabic.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-tophat-campaign-attacks-within-the-middle-east-region-using-popular-third-party-services/\n2019-01: “Spark” Campaign\nThis campaign uses social engineering to infect victims, mainly from the Palestinian territories, with the Spark backdoor. This backdoor first emerged in January 2019 and has been continuously active since then. The campaign’s lure content revolves around recent geopolitical events, espeically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Fatah Palestinian movements.\nwww.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-one\n2019-02: New Attack in the Middle East\nRecently, 360 Threat Intelligence Center captured a bait document designed specifically for Arabic users. It is an Office Word document with malicious macros embedded to drop and execute a backdoor packed by Enigma Virtual Box. The backdoor program has a built-in keyword list containing names of people or opera movies to communicate with C2, distributes control commands to further control the victim’s computer device. After investigation, we suspect this attack is carried out by Molerats.\nti.360.net/blog/articles/suspected-molerats-new-attack-in-the-middle-east-en/\n2019-04: Operation “SneakyPastes”\nThe campaign is multistage. It begins with phishing, using letters from one-time addresses and one-time domains. Sometimes the letters contain links to malware or infected attachments. If the victim executes the attached file (or follows the link), their device receives Stage One malware programmed to activate the infection chain.\nwww.kaspersky.com/blog/gaza-cybergang/26363/\n2019-10: Between October 2019 through the beginning of December 2019, Unit 42 observed multiple instances of phishing attacks likely related to a threat group known as Molerats (AKA Gaza Hackers Team and Gaza Cybergang) targeting eight organizations in six different countries in the government, telecommunications, insurance and retail industries, of which the latter two were quite peculiar.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/molerats-delivers-spark-backdoor/\n2019-12: “Pierogi” Campaign\nThis campaign uses social engineering attacks to infect victims with a new, undocumented backdoor dubbed Pierogi. This backdoor first emerged in December 2019, and was discovered by Cybereason.

Linked with the spam distribution of the Dridex gang, it is used to spread one of the world’s most nefarious banking Trojans. It also moved to mass distributing Locky, Dridex’s ransomware child, then added distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Like the previous campaigns, these samples again involve a Microsoft Word document embedded with a malicious macro that is capable of executing PowerShell (PS) scripts leading to a backdoor payload. One notable difference in the analyzed samples is that they do not directly download the Visual Basic Script(VBS) and PowerShell component files, and instead encode all the scripts on the document itself. The scripts will then be decoded and dropped to execute the payload without needing to download the component files.\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/another-potential-muddywater-campaign-uses-powershell-based-prb-backdoor/\n2018-05: We recently noticed a large amount of spear phishing documents that appear to be targeting government bodies, military entities, telcos and educational institutions in Jordan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Pakistan, in addition to the continuous targeting of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, other victims were also detected in Mali, Austria, Russia, Iran and Bahrain..

In particular, Mummy Spider usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version.\nAfter a 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation in December 2016 but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is currently acting as a ‘loader’ delivering other malware packages. The primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot.\nMummy Spider advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use by Mummy Spider or with a small trusted group of customers.\nEmotet has been observed to distribute BokBot (Lunar Spider), Dridex (Indrik Spider), DoppelPaymer (Doppel Spider), Zeus Panda (Bamboo Spider, TA544) and Trickbot (Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn), as well as QakBot (Mallard Spider).\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverMummy SpiderCrowdStrikeTA542ProofpointATK 104ThalesMealybugSymantecGold CrestwoodSecureWorks\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\n\nFirst Seen\n2014\nObserved Sectors\n\nDefense\nEnergy\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nManufacturing\nRetail\nShipping and Logistics\nUtilities\nTechnology\n\nObserved Countries\n\nWorldwide\n\nTools\n\nEmotet\n\nOperations\n\n2017-08: While the earlier variants of EMOTET primarily targeted the banking sector, our Smart Protection Network (SPN) data reveals that this time, the malware isn’t being picky about the industries it chooses to attack. The affected companies come from different industries, including manufacturing, food and beverage, and healthcare.

Further analysis revealed a wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This adversary targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in general, but uses Mongolian language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor has a specific focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns involve the use of shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX.\nRecently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from Mustang Panda, using a unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims. This newly observed activity uses a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of legitimate tools to gain access to the targeted systems.

The new sample detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_RARSTONE.A is similar (but not) PlugX, as it directly loads a backdoor “file” in memory without dropping any “file”.

There’s a level of variable developmental capability visible throughout the stages. Multiple components are abused commonly-available resources, while the orchestrator and two of the DLL drops actually display some developmental ingenuity (in the form of seemingly novel COM techniques). Far from the most advanced coding practices but definitely better than the sort of .NET garbage other ‘Farsi-speaking’ APTs have gotten away with in the past.\nSomehow, this operation found its way onto the NSA’s radar pre-2013. As far as I can tell, it’s eluded specific coverage from the security industry. A possible scenario to account for the disparate visibility between the NSA and Western researchers when it comes to this cluster of activity is that these samples were exclusively encountered on Iranian boxes overlapping with EQGRP implants. Submissions of Nazar subcomponents from Iran (as well as privately shared visibility into historical and ongoing victimology clustered entirely on Iranian machines) could support that theory.

These attacks have involved social engineering, spear-phishing attacks, exploitation of Microsoft Windows operating systems vulnerabilities, Microsoft Active Directory compromises, and the use of remote administration tools (RATs) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations.\nAttackers using several locations in China have leveraged C&amp;C servers on purchased hosted services in the United States and compromised servers in the Netherlands to wage attacks against global oil, gas, and petrochemical companies, as well as individuals and executives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, and the United States to acquire proprietary and highly confidential information. The primary operational technique used by the attackers comprised a variety of hacker tools, including privately developed and customized RAT tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker. RATs provide functions similar to Citrix or Microsoft Windows Terminal Services, allowing a remote individual to completely control the affected system. To deploy these tools, attackers first compromised perimeter security controls, through SQL-injection exploits of extranet web servers, as well as targeted spear-phishing attacks of mobile worker laptops, and compromising corporate VPN accounts to penetrate the targeted company’s defensive architectures (DMZs and firewalls) and conduct reconnaissance of targeted companies’ networked computers.\nNight Dragon may be related to APT 18, Dynamite Panda, Wekby.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverNight DragonMcAfee\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2009\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\nOil and gas\nPetrochemical\n\nObserved Countries\n\nGreece\nKazakhstan\nNetherlands\nTaiwan\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nASPXSpy\nCain &amp; Abel\ngsecdump\nzwShell\n\nInformation\n\nsecuringtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/McAfee_NightDragon_wp_draft_to_customersv1-1.pdf\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0014/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n4feaae3b-b420-4bd0-ad22-1eccf413d53b\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-22"},"NightSky":{"slug":"NightSky","filePath":"NightSky.md","title":"NightSky","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"NightSky\nDescription\nNo description available yet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameNightSkyNight Sky\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nRansomware\n\nInformation\n\nwww.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/night-sky-is-the-latest-ransomware-targeting-corporate-networks/\nwww.secureworks.com/research/bronze-starlight-ransomware-operations-use-hui-loader\nwww.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation\nwww.cynet.com/attack-techniques-hands-on/threats-looming-over-the-horizon/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.nightsky\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n76cb95e8-e65d-48c4-b900-2fc1d10aed94\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-27"},"Nightdoor":{"slug":"Nightdoor","filePath":"Nightdoor.md","title":"Nightdoor","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Nightdoor\nDescription\n(ESET) The backdoor that we have named Nightdoor (and is named NetMM by the malware authors according to PDB paths) is a late addition to Evasive Panda’s toolset.

The threat group is notable because it employs Visual Basic Scripts (VBScripts) as a backdoor, a tactic we do not often observe. The group can maintain a low profile probably because the VBScripts are small and stealthy in their execution. The NINEBLOG malware is difficult to detect because the VBScripts are encoded and the actors employ SSL network communications. We have observed intermittent activity from this group since we first identified it in 2013, and we saw a spike in activity during mid-2015.\nWe assess that one of the probable targets of the group’s 2015 campaign is a Southeast Asian government, based on the specificity of some of the decoy documents.\nIn addition to the anti-analysis techniques, the group has used SSL communications since we first identified this activity in 2013.

According to malware analysis, NotPetya attempts the lateral movement techniques below:\n• PsExec - a legitimate Windows administration tool\n• WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation, a legitimate Windows component\n• EternalBlue - the same Windows SMBv1 exploit used by WannaCry\n• EternalRomance - another Windows SMBv1 exploit\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameNotPetyaEternalPetyaExPetrPnyetyaPetnaNyetyaNonPetyanPetyaPetrwrapDiskcoder.CGoldenEye\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nRansomware\nWiper\nWorm\nRemote command\n\nInformation\n\nwww.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A\nsecurelist.com/from-blackenergy-to-expetr/78937/\nwww.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html\nblogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/29/windows-10-platform-resilience-against-the-petya-ransomware-attack/\nlabsblog.f-secure.com/2017/06/30/eternal-petya-from-a-developers-perspective/\nsecurelist.com/expetrpetyanotpetya-is-a-wiper-not-ransomware/78902/\nthreatpost.com/ukrainian-man-arrested-charged-in-notpetya-distribution/127391/\nblog.erratasec.com/2017/06/nonpetya-no-evidence-it-was-smokescreen.html\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/petrwrap-technical-analysis-part-2-further-findings-and-potential-for-mbr-recovery/\nwww.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2017/september/eternalglue-part-one-rebuilding-notpetya-to-assess-real-world-resilience/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/eternalpetya-yet-another-stolen-piece-package/\nlabsblog.f-secure.com/2017/06/29/petya-i-want-to-believe/\nwww.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/03/notpetya-malware-attacks-ukraine-warrant-retaliation-nato-researcher-tomas-minarik\nblog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/07/keeping-up-with-the-petyas-demystifying-the-malware-family/\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/fast-spreading-petrwrap-ransomware-attack-combines-eternalblue-exploit-credential-stealing/\nblog.comae.io/petya-2017-is-a-wiper-not-a-ransomware-9ea1d8961d3b\nblog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/worldwide-ransomware-variant.html\nsecurelist.com/schroedingers-petya/78870/\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/30/telebots-back-supply-chain-attacks-against-ukraine/\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attacks-continue-in-ukraine-with-mysterious-wannacry-clone/\nwww.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2017/07/29859-who-is-behind-petna\nmedium.com/@thegrugq/pnyetya-yet-another-ransomware-outbreak-59afd1ee89d4\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2017/10/24/kiev-metro-hit-new-variant-infamous-diskcoder-ransomware/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/eternalpetya-lost-salsa20-key/\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/\nisc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Checking+out+the+new+Petya+variant/22562/\ntisiphone.net/2017/06/28/why-notpetya-kept-me-awake-you-should-worry-too/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/05/petya-and-mischa-ransomware-duet-p1/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/07/third-time-unlucky-improved-petya-is-out/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2017/07/bye-bye-petya-decryptor-old-versions-released/\nblog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/04/petya-ransomware/\nwww.dropbox.com/s/hksfa7zzc17jgrq/Whitepaper%20Petya%20Ransomware.pdf\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0368/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.eternal_petya\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.petya\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:notpetya\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf1c756d0-c922-45d9-94d5-fb355f523add\nLast Card Change\n2020-05-21"},"Ntospy":{"slug":"Ntospy","filePath":"Ntospy.md","title":"Ntospy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Ntospy\nDescription\n(Palo Alto) To perform credential theft, the threat actor used a custom DLL module implementing a Network Provider.

Sergey Polak demonstrated the technique at BlackHat back in 2004 at his session titled “Capturing Windows Passwords using the Network Provider API.” In 2020, researcher Grzegorz Tworek uploaded his tool NPPSpy to GitHub, which also implements this technique.\nDue to the file naming patterns of the DLL module, and as a reference to the previous research and tools, Unit 42 researchers named this malware family Ntospy.

The group has targeted a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East. It appears the group carries out supply chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets. FireEye assesses that the group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.

It is a destructive malware that corrupts files on a compromised computer and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render a computer unusable.\nTarget: Saudi Aramco and Rasgas.\nwww.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-attacks\n2016-05: Targeted Attacks against Banks in the Middle East\nIn the first week of May 2016, FireEye’s DTI identified a wave of emails containing malicious attachments being sent to multiple banks in the Middle East region. The threat actors appear to be performing initial reconnaissance against would-be targets, and the attacks caught our attention since they were using unique scripts not commonly seen in crimeware campaigns.\nwww.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-on-saudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/\n2016-06: We have identified two separate testing efforts carried out by the OilRig actors, one occurring in June and one in November of 2016. The sample set associated with each of these testing activities is rather small, but the changes made to each of the files give us a chance to understand what modifications the actor performs in an attempt to evade detection. This testing activity also suggests that the threat group responsible for the OilRig attack campaign have an organized, professional operations model that includes a testing component to the development of their tools.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-actors-provide-glimpse-development-testing-efforts/\n2016-10: In recent weeks we’ve discovered that the group have been actively updating their Clayslide delivery documents, as well as the Helminth backdoor used against victims. Additionally, the scope of organizations targeted by this group has expanded to not only include organizations within Saudi Arabia, but also a company in Qatar and government organizations in Turkey, Israel and the United States.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-malware-campaign-updates-toolset-and-expands-targets/\n2016-11: Shamoon v2\nThe malware used in the recent attacks (W32.Disttrack.B) is largely unchanged from the variant used four years ago. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their master boot records wiped and replaced with an image of a burning US flag. The latest attacks instead used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi, the three year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean last year.\nwww.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-back-dead-and-destructive-ever\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-second-wave-shamoon-2-attacks-identified/\n2017-01: Delivers Digitally Signed Malware, Impersonates University of Oxford\nIn recent attacks they set up a fake VPN Web Portal and targeted at least five Israeli IT vendors, several financial institutes, and the Israeli Post Office.\nLater, the attackers set up two fake websites pretending to be a University of Oxford conference sign-up page and a job application website. In these websites they hosted malware that was digitally signed with a valid, likely stolen code signing certificate.\nwww.clearskysec.com/oilrig/\n2017-06: In July 2017, we observed the OilRig group using a tool they developed called ISMAgent in a new set of targeted attacks. The OilRig group developed ISMAgent as a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan. In August 2017, we found this threat group has developed yet another Trojan that they call ‘Agent Injector’ with the specific purpose of installing the ISMAgent backdoor. We are tracking this tool as ISMInjector.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-group-steps-attacks-new-delivery-documents-new-injector-trojan/\n2017-07: The web server logs on the system we examined that was compromised with the TwoFace shell gave us a glimpse into the commands the actor executed through their malware.

Just over a week later, on January 16, 2018, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern financial institution. In both attacks, the OilRig group attempted to deliver a new Trojan that we are tracking as OopsIE.\nThe January 8 attack used a variant of the ThreeDollars delivery document, which we identified as part of the OilRig toolset based on attacks that occurred in August 2017.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oopsie-oilrig-uses-threedollars-deliver-new-trojan/\n2018-01: While investigating files uploaded to a TwoFace webshell, Unit 42 discovered actors installing an Internet Information Services (IIS) backdoor that we call RGDoor. Our data suggests that actors have deployed the RGDoor backdoor on webservers belonging to eight Middle Eastern government organizations, as well as one financial and one educational institution.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-uses-rgdoor-iis-backdoor-targets-middle-east/\n2018-05: Technology Service Provider and Government Agency\nBetween May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the OilRig group appearing to originate from a government agency in the Middle East. Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the OilRig group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks.\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-targets-technology-service-provider-government-agency-quadagent/\n2018-12: Shamoon v3\nAfter a two-year absence, the destructive malware Shamoon (W32.Disttrack.B) re-emerged on December 10 in a new wave of attacks against targets in the Middle East. These latest Shamoon attacks are doubly destructive, since they involve a new wiper (Trojan.Filerase) that deletes files from infected computers before the Shamoon malware wipes the master boot record.\nwww.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail\nsecuringtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/shamoon-attackers-employ-new-tool-kit-to-wipe-infected-systems/\n2019-06: [W]e identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET, malware exclusively observed in use by APT34.

From a technical perspective, the purpose of the malware is to deliver and start the wiper payload which attempts to destroy files on the remote network shares over the next 60 minutes. Meanwhile, the main module collects user passwords from browser and Windows storage and crafts a new generation of the worm that contains old and freshly collected compromised credentials. The new generation of the worm is pushed to accessible local network computers and starts using the PsExec tool, leveraging the collected credentials and current user privileges.\nOnce the wiper has run for 60 minutes it cleans Windows event logs, resets backups, deletes shadow copies from the file system, disables the recovery item in the Windows boot menu, disables all the services on the system and reboots the computer. Those files on the network shares that it managed to wipe within 60 minutes remain destroyed. The malware doesn’t use any persistence and even contains protection (also a killswitch) against recurring reinfection. Incidentally, only 1MB of the remote files are fully overwritten with zeroes; larger files were wiped with just 1K of zeroes in the header.

Its previous campaigns used watering hole tactics as an infection vector, using websites that discussed topics related to North Korea. Our continuous monitoring of this threat campaign shows that the threat actor behind SLUB didn’t stop their attacks even during the pandemic. In 2020, we found multiple instances of their attacks in March, May, and September, delivering a new variant of the malware — this time incorporating new techniques and capabilities.\nIn addition, we found two unknown malware variants delivered along with SLUB during the latest attack at the end of September. Besides the CVEs already mentioned in the previous SLUB blog, we also found new exploits for the vulnerabilities CVE-2016-0189, CVE-2019-1458, CVE-2020-0674, and CVE-2019-5782, chained with another Chrome bug that does not have an associated CVE.\nThe campaign is very diversified, deploying numerous samples to the victim machines and using multiple command-and-control (C&amp;C) servers during this operation. In total, we found the campaign using five C&amp;C servers, seven samples, and exploits for four N-day bugs.

Various artifacts indicate that the main target of this campaign is IEC – Israel Electric Company. These include domains, file names, Java package names, and Facebook activity. We dubbed this campaign “Operation Electric Powder“.\nIsrael Electric Company (also known as Israel Electric Corporation) “is the largest supplier of electrical power in Israel. The IEC builds, maintains, and operates power generation stations, sub-stations, as well as transmission and distribution networks. The company is the sole integrated electric utility in the State of Israel. It installed generating capacity represents about 75% of the total electricity production capacity in the country.”\nIt is notable that the operational level and the technological sophistication of the attackers are not high. Also, they are having hard time preparing decoy documents and websites in Hebrew and English. Therefore, in most cases a vigilant target should be able to notice the attack and avoid infection. We do not have indication that the attacks succeeded in infecting IEC related computers or stealing information.\nCurrently we do not know who is behind Operation Electric Powder or what its objectives are.\nAlso see WildCard.\nThis actor is reported as potentially linked to the threat actor known as Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang, but no strong evidence has been found.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverOperation Electric PowderClearSky\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2016\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\n\nObserved Countries\n\nIsrael\n\nTools\n\nSysJoker\n\nInformation\n\nwww.clearskysec.com/iec/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n34997eb0-9e4f-4a2f-8a2b-dccc60fdc098\nLast Card Change\n2023-11-30"},"Operation-EmailThief,-TEMP_Heretic":{"slug":"Operation-EmailThief,-TEMP_Heretic","filePath":"Operation EmailThief, TEMP_Heretic.md","title":"Operation EmailThief, TEMP_Heretic","links":["China","Government","Media","Europe"],"tags":[],"content":"Operation EmailThief, TEMP_Heretic\nDescription\n(Volexity) In December 2021, through its Network Security Monitoring service, Volexity identified a series of targeted spear-phishing campaigns against one of its customers from a threat actor it tracks as TEMP_Heretic. Analysis of the emails from these spear phishing campaigns led to a discovery: the attacker was attempting to exploit a zero-day cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Zimbra email platform. Zimbra is an open source email platform often used by organizations as an alternative to Microsoft Exchange.\nThe campaigns came in multiple waves across two attack phases. The initial phase was aimed at reconnaissance and involved emails designed to simply track if a target received and opened the messages. The second phase came in several waves that contained email messages luring targets to click a malicious attacker-crafted link. For the attack to be successful, the target would have to visit the attacker’s link while logged into the Zimbra webmail client from a web browser. The link itself, however, could be launched from an application to include a thick client, such as Thunderbird or Outlook. Successful exploitation results in the attacker being able to run arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user’s Zimbra session.

The attackers try to lure targets through spear phishing emails that include compressed executables. The malware collects all data such as passwords, keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers.\nWe found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly industrial, engineering and manufacturing organizations in more than 30 countries. In total, over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March 2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of their activities, the attackers’ motivations are apparently financial, whether through the victims’ banking accounts or through selling their intellectual property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30-300 employees), the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverOperation GhoulKaspersky\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2016\nObserved Sectors\n\nEducation\nEngineering\nIndustrial\nManufacturing\nIT\nPharmaceutical\nShipping and Logistics\nTourism and Trading\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAzerbaijan\nChina\nEgypt\nFrance\nGermany\nGibraltar\nIndia\nIran\nIraq\nItaly\nPakistan\nPortugal\nRomania\nQatar\nSaudi Arabia\nSpain\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nTurkey\nUAE\nUK\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nOpGhoul\n\nInformation\n\nsecurelist.com/operation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations/75718/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n7ad2d47f-2f79-4d4a-aeaa-137747a961df\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-14"},"Operation-Groundbait":{"slug":"Operation-Groundbait","filePath":"Operation Groundbait.md","title":"Operation Groundbait","links":["Operation-Potao-Express","Ukraine","Government","politicians-and-journalists","Prikormka"],"tags":[],"content":"Operation Groundbait\nDescription\n(ESET) After BlackEnergy, which has, most infamously, facilitated attacks that resulted in power outages for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and Operation Potao Express, where attackers went after sensitive TrueCrypt-protected data from high value targets, ESET researchers have uncovered another cyberespionage operation in Ukraine: Operation Groundbait.\nThe main point that sets Operation Groundbait apart from the other attacks is that it has mostly been targeting anti-government separatists in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics.\nWhile the attackers seem to be more interested in separatists and the self-declared governments in eastern Ukrainian war zones, there have also been a large number of other targets, including, among others, Ukrainian government officials, politicians and journalists.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverOperation GroundbaitESET\nCountry\n\nUkraine\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2008\nObserved Sectors\n\nGovernment\npoliticians and journalists\n\nObserved Countries\n\nUkraine\n\nTools\n\nPrikormka\n\nInformation\n\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2016/05/18/groundbait/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n38246b37-a51f-4980-800e-bc591e986073\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-15"},"Operation-HangOver,-Monsoon,-Viceroy-Tiger":{"slug":"Operation-HangOver,-Monsoon,-Viceroy-Tiger","filePath":"Operation HangOver, Monsoon, Viceroy Tiger.md","title":"Operation HangOver, Monsoon, Viceroy Tiger","links":["India","Defense","Government","Hospitality","Telecommunications","Austria","Bangladesh","Canada","China","France","Germany","Indonesia","Iran","Jordan","Kuwait","Myanmar","Norway","Oman","Panama","Pakistan","Poland","Romania","Russia","Singapore","Sri-Lanka","Taiwan","Thailand","UAE","UK","USA","Africa-and-Far-East","AutoIt-backdoor","BackConfig","BADNEWS","TINYTYPHON","Unknown-Logger","WSCSPL"],"tags":[],"content":"Operation HangOver, Monsoon, Viceroy Tiger\nDescription\n(Shadowserver Foundation) On Sunday March 17th 2013 the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten reported that the telecommunications giant Telenor had filed a case with Norwegian criminal police (“KRIPOS”) over what was perceived as an unlawful intrusion into their computer network. The infection was reported to have been conducted via “spear phishing” emails sent to people in the upper tiers of management.\nInitially, we had no information or visibility into this case. However, after some time Norwegian CERT (NorCERT) shared some data from the event, which included md5 hashes of malicious files and information about which Command and Control servers were used.\nHowever, the data we were given acted as a starting point for more data mining, and within a short period of time it became obvious that we were seeing a previously unknown and very extensive infrastructure for targeted attacks. This paper is the result of the ensuing investigation.\nThe samples we have uncovered seem to have been created from approximately September 2010 until the present day. It appears 2012 was a very active year for this group, which saw escalation not only in numbers of created malware files but also in targets.

This post will show how we discovered previous campaigns targeting the aviation industry, which links back to an actor that’s been active for approximately six years.\nWe believe the actor is based out of Nigeria with a high degree of confidence and doesn’t seem to be technically sophisticated, using off-the-shelf malware since the beginning of its activities without developing its own malware. The actor also buys the crypters that allow the usage of such malware without being detected, throughout the years it has used several different cryptors, mostly bought on online forums.\nWe also believe with a high degree of confidence that the actor has been active for at least five years. For the last two, they’ve been targeting the aviation industry, while conducting other campaigns at the same time.

The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was obtained.

McAfee has detected the malware variants and other relevant indicators for years with Generic Downloader.x and Generic BackDoor.t heuristic signatures (those who have had prior experience with this specific adversary may recognize it by the use of encrypted HTML comments in web pages that serve as a command channel to the infected machine).\nMcAfee has gained access to one specific Command &amp; Control server used by the intruders. We have collected logs that reveal the full extent of the victim population since mid-2006 when the log collection began. Note that the actual intrusion activity may have begun well before that time but that is the earliest evidence we have for the start of the compromises. The compromises themselves were standard procedure for these types of targeted intrusions: a spear-phishing email containing an exploit is sent to an individual with the right level of access at the company, and the exploit when opened on an unpatched system will trigger a download of the implant malware. That malware will execute and initiate a backdoor communication channel to the Command &amp; Control web server and interpret the instructions encoded in the hidden comments embedded in the webpage code.

Once we looked into the file, we quickly found out that the inner-workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information.\nDuring the course of our research, we noticed that we were not the only ones to have found the operation. Researchers from Bitdefender also released an analysis of one of the samples in a blogpost. Although something had already been published, we decided to do something different with the data we acquired.

However this operation is not about stealing company resources or altering Linux’s source code as we will unveil throughout the report.\nThe complexity of the backdoors deployed by the malicious actors shows out of the ordinary knowledge of operating systems and programming.

What actually happens is that the malware is able to decode data from the PDF documents and interpret it as commands for the backdoor.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameOutlook BackdoorFACADE\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nInfo stealer\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nwww.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eset-Turla-Outlook-Backdoor.pdf\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.outlook_backdoor\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n4deb4745-67e2-4865-ad95-c02d48c33726\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-23"},"Overlord-Spider":{"slug":"Overlord-Spider","filePath":"Overlord Spider.md","title":"Overlord Spider","links":["Unknown"],"tags":[],"content":"Overlord Spider\nDescription\nA threat actor mentioned in a summary report only, so we don’t know who they are yet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverOverlord SpiderCrowdStrikeThe Dark Overlord?\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n7dba1c17-e639-4bc7-a420-ce6160d95619\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-31"},"OwaAuth":{"slug":"OwaAuth","filePath":"OwaAuth.md","title":"OwaAuth","links":["China-Chopper"],"tags":[],"content":"OwaAuth\nDescription\n(SecureWorks) A web shell and credential stealer deployed to Microsoft Exchange servers.

For example, Figure 11 shows the CLR headers of a sample masquerading as a WinRAR DLL.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamePNGLoad\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nLoader\n\nInformation\n\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/06/worok-big-picture/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.png_load\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf9459882-ea88-44c9-aaa5-b4f51918e0f5\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-27"},"POOLRAT":{"slug":"POOLRAT","filePath":"POOLRAT.md","title":"POOLRAT","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"POOLRAT\nDescription\n(Mandiant) POOLRAT is a C/C++ macOS backdoor capable of collecting basic system information and executing commands.

The backdoor’s infrequent beaconing, traffic obfuscation, extensive encryption and use of geographically local, legitimate websites for command and control (C2) make identification of its network traffic difficult.

The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters.\nAfter observing a wave of attacks in Ecuador in 2015, we linked these attacks to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014. The targeting in Argentina was discovered when the attackers attempted to compromise the devices of Alberto Nisman and Jorge Lanata. Building on what we had learned about these two campaigns, we then traced the group’s activities back as far as 2008.\nThis report brings together many of the pieces of this campaign, from malware and phishing, to command and control infrastructure spread across Latin America. It also highlights fake online organizations that Packrat has created in Venezuela and Ecuador. Who is responsible? We assess several scenarios, and consider the most likely to be that Packrat is sponsored by a state actor or actors, given their apparent lack of concern about discovery, their targets, and their persistence. However, we do not conclusively attribute Packrat to a particular sponsor.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverPackratCitizen Lab\nCountry\n\nLatin America\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation

Though the campaign, the attackers succeeded in gaining access and persistent foothold in the networks of numerous companies and organizations from the IT,Telecommunication,Oil and Gas, Aviation, Government, and Security sectors around the world.\nDuring our analysis, we have found an overlap, with medium-high probability, between this campaign’s infrastructure and the activity of an Iranian offensive group OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene. Additionally, we have identified, with medium probability, a connection between this campaign and the APT 33, Elfin, Magnallium and Chafer, APT 39 groups.The campaign was first revealed by Dragos, named “Parisite”and attributed to APT33; we call the comprehensive campaign revealed in this report “Fox Kitten”.\nThe initial breach of the targeted organizations was performed, in most cases, by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in different VPN services such as: Pulse Secure VPN, Fortinet VPN, and Global Protect by Palo Alto Networks. Upon gaining foothold at the target, the attackers tried to maintain the access to the networks by opening a variety of communication tools, including opening RDP links over SSH tunneling, in order to camouflage and encrypt the communication with the targets. At the final stage, after successfully infiltrating the organization, the attackers have performed a routine process of identification, examination, and filtering of sensitive, valuable information from every targeted organization.The valuable information was sent back to the attackers for reconnaissance, espionage, or further infection of connected networks.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverParisiteDragosFox KittenClearSkyPioneer KittenCrowdstrikeCobalt FoxgloveSecureWorksRubidiumMicrosoftUNC757?Lemon SandstormMicrosoft\nCountry\n\nIran\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nAviation\nChemical\nEnergy\nDefense\nEngineering\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nIT\nMedia\nManufacturing\nOil and gas\nRetail\nTelecommunications\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nAustria\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nHungary\nIsrael\nItaly\nKuwait\nLebanon\nMalaysia\nPoland\nSaudi Arabia\nUAE\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nFRP\nInvoke the Hash\nJuicyPotato\nNgrok\nPay2Key\nPort.exe\nPOWSSHNET\nPlink\nPuTTY\nServeo\nSSHMinion\nSTSRCheck\n\nOperations\n\n2019 Late: “Fox Kitten” Campaign\nwww.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ClearSky-Fox-Kitten-Campaign-v1.pdf\n2020-07: In late July 2020, an actor assessed to be associated with PIONEER KITTEN was identified as advertising to sell access to compromised networks on an underground forum.\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-pioneer-kitten/\n2020-09: This threat actor has been observed exploiting several publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) dealing with Pulse Secure virtual private network (VPN), Citrix NetScaler, and F5 vulnerabilities.\nus-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-259a\n2020-11: Pay2Kitten – Fox Kitten 2\nwww.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pay2Kitten.pdf\n\nInformation\n\ndragos.com/blog/industry-news/the-state-of-threats-to-electric-entities-in-north-america/\nthreatpost.com/oil-and-gas-specialist-apt-pivots-to-u-s-power-plants/151699/\nwww.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ClearSky-Fox-Kitten-Campaign-v1.pdf\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-pioneer-kitten/\nwww.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-241a\ncensys.com/analysis-of-fox-kitten-infrastructure-reveals-unique-host-patterns-and-potentially-new-iocs/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0117/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n9d13d133-e25a-4de0-8952-6b0cbdb92899\nLast Card Change\n2024-10-23"},"ParkingBear":{"slug":"ParkingBear","filePath":"ParkingBear.md","title":"ParkingBear","links":["Unknown"],"tags":[],"content":"ParkingBear\nDescription\nA threat actor mentioned in a summary report only, so we don’t know who they are yet.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverParkingBearKaspersky\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nInformation\n\nsecurelist.com/apt-review-of-the-year/89117/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ndffc1f9c-bc02-4755-8e7b-e452f3362607\nLast Card Change\n2020-05-01"},"PartialWasher-Wiper":{"slug":"PartialWasher-Wiper","filePath":"PartialWasher Wiper.md","title":"PartialWasher Wiper","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"PartialWasher Wiper\nDescription\n(Palo Alto) During the attack, the attackers attempted to use a second wiper, which they call PartialWasher or PW.

His post provides a good introduction to the group and covers some of the older infrastructure, stolen code-signing certificate reuse, and other connections associated with the PassCV malware. There are several clues alluding to the possibility that multiple groups may be utilizing the same stolen signing certificates, but at this time SPEAR believes the current attacks are more likely being perpetrated by a single group employing multiple publicly available Remote Administration Tools (RATs).\nThe PassCV group has been operating with continued success and has already started to expand their malware repertoire into different off-the-shelf RATs and custom code. SPEAR identified eighteen previously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates. These certificates were originally issued to companies and individuals scattered across China, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the United States and Russia.\nThe PassCV group typically utilized publicly available RATs in addition to some custom code, which ultimately provided backdoor functionality to affected systems via phony resumes and curriculum vitae (CVs).

It also takes pictures, captures screenshots, records audios, intercepts and sends SMS messages. In addition, it can log the keyboard input by the Android accessibility service, acting as a keylogger.\nPluginPhantom is a new class of Google Android Trojan: it is the first to use updating and to evade static detection. It does this by leveraging the Android plugin technology. It abuses the legitimate and popular open source framework “DroidPlugin”, which allows an app to dynamically launch any apps as plugins without installing them in the system. PluginPhantom implements each element of malicious functionality as a plugin, and utilizes a host app to control the plugins. With the new architecture, PluginPhantom achieves more flexibility to update its modules without reinstalling apps. PluginPhantom also gains the ability to evade the static detection by hiding malicious behaviors in plugins. Since the plugin development pattern is generic and the plugin SDK can be easily embedded, the plugin architecture could be a trend among Android malware in the future.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamePluginPhantom\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nInfo stealer\nCredential stealer\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-pluginphantom-new-android-trojan-abuses-droidplugin-framework/\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:pluginphantom\n\nOther Information\nUuid\na56b62e0-d456-4098-bfae-a86aeae21b49\nLast Card Change\n2020-07-02"},"PlushDaemon":{"slug":"PlushDaemon","filePath":"PlushDaemon.md","title":"PlushDaemon","links":["China","Hong-Kong","New-Zealand","South-Korea","Taiwan","USA","SlowStepper"],"tags":[],"content":"PlushDaemon\nDescription\n(ESET) In May 2024, we noticed detections of malicious code in an NSIS installer for Windows that users from South Korea had downloaded from the website of the legitimate VPN software IPany (ipany.kr/; see Figure 1), which is developed by a South Korean company.

The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called “Evil Eye” reported by Volexity. The Android malware used in the campaign is a fully featured spyware kit that has not been previously documented.\n• POISON CARP appears to have used Android browser exploits from a variety of sources. In one case, POISON CARP used a working exploit publicly released by Exodus Intelligence for a Google Chrome bug that was fixed in source, but whose patch had not yet been distributed to Chrome users. In other cases, POISON CARP used lightly modified versions of Chrome exploit code published on the personal GitHub pages of a member of Qihoo 360’s Vulcan Team, a member of Tencent’s Xuanwu Lab, and by a Google Project Zero member on the Chrome Bug Tracker.\n• This campaign is the first documented case of one-click mobile exploits used to target Tibetan groups, and reflects an escalation in the sophistication of digital espionage threats targeting the community.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverPoison CarpCitizen LabEvil EyeVolexityEarth EmpusaTrend MicroRed Dev 16PWCEvilBambooVolexitySentinel TaurusPalo Alto\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2018\nObserved Sectors\n\nTibetan and Uyghur activists as well as those who are interested in their causes\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nCanada\nChina\nKazakhstan\nSyria\nTurkey\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nActionSpy\nBadBazaar\nBADSIGNAL\nBADSOLAR\nBourbon\nIceCube\nIRONSQUIRREL\nMOONSHINE\nPoisonCarp\nScotch\nWhisky\nseveral exploits in iOS, Android and Google Chrome\n\nOperations\n\n2018: Digital Crackdown: Large-Scale Surveillance and Exploitation of Uyghurs\nwww.volexity.com/blog/2019/09/02/digital-crackdown-large-scale-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-uyghurs/\n2020-01: Immediately after the publications from Google and Volexity, the Evil Eye threat actor went fairly quiet.

This signals just how long ago the Poseidon threat actor was already working on its offensive framework.\nThe Poseidon Group is a long-running team operating on all domains: land, air, and sea. They are dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively collect information from company networks through the use of spear-phishing packaged with embedded, executable elements inside office documents and extensive lateral movement tools. The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by a company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm. Even when contracted, the Poseidon Group may continue its infection or initiate another infection at a later time, persisting on the network to continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation. The Poseidon Group has been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005. Their tools are consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems spanning the gamut of Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use of hijacked satellite connections.

In that specific case, it allows an executable launched by a restricted user to gain administrative rights.\nThe tweet linked to a GitHub repository that contains Proof-of-Concept code for the exploit. Not only was a compiled version released – the source code was also. Consequently, anyone can modify and recompile the exploit, in order to “improve it”, evade detection, or even incorporate it into their code.\nAs one could have predicted, it took only two days before we first identified the use of this exploit in a malicious campaign from a group we have dubbed PowerPool.

We therefore named this malware Purple Lambert. Purple Lambert is composed of several modules, with its network module passively listening for a magic packet. It is capable of providing an attacker with basic information about the infected system and executing a received payload. Its functionality reminds us of Gray Lambert, another user-mode passive listener.

It consists of a compact set of statically linked Qt libraries along with some user-written code. The Qt framework is a platform for developing cross-platform applications. However, it is immensely popular for developing Graphical User Interface in applications. Although QuiteRAT, just like MagicRAT, uses embedded Qt libraries, none of these implants have a Graphical User Interface. .As seen with Lazarus Group’s MagicRAT malware, the use of Qt increases the code complexity, making human analysis harder. Using Qt also makes machine learning and heuristic analysis detection less reliable, since Qt is rarely used in malware development.\nBased on QuiteRAT’s technical characteristics, including the usage of the Qt framework, we assess that this implant belongs to the previously disclosed MagicRAT family. QuiteRAT was briefly discussed in WithSecure’s report from early 2023.

This is a shift in tactics, but we suspect that this group constantly changes the way they deploy malware—and that the group has conducted campaigns prior to this past November.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverRATicateSophos\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2019\nObserved Sectors\n\nIndustrial\nManufacturing\nMedia\nTelecommunications\n\nObserved Countries\n\nRomania\nJapan\nKuwait\nSouth Korea\nSwitzerland\nUK\nEurope and Middle East\n\nTools\n\nAgent Tesla\nBetaBot\nBlackRAT\nFormbook\nGuLoader\nLokiBot\nNetWire RC\nnjRAT\nNSIS\nRemcosRAT\n\nInformation\n\nnews.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/14/raticate/\nnews.sophos.com/en-us/2020/07/14/raticate-rats-as-service-with-commercial-crypter/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n30e5ac74-bfff-470f-ba68-a9f34ea7c57b\nLast Card Change\n2020-07-15"},"RC-SHELL":{"slug":"RC-SHELL","filePath":"RC SHELL.md","title":"RC SHELL","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"RC SHELL\nDescription\nPublicly available PHP backdoor.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameRC SHELL\nCategory\nTools\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-clever-kitten/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n9ac61b6c-10bc-4307-9a34-8b7888c7dfe3\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-20"},"RCLONE":{"slug":"RCLONE","filePath":"RCLONE.md","title":"RCLONE","links":["Conti","DarkSide"],"tags":[],"content":"RCLONE\nDescription\nRclone is a command line program for syncing files with cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon S3, and MEGA.

A trend that we have seen unfold before our eyes lately is these cybercriminals’ use of simple backdoors to gain a foothold in their targets’ networks.

Some of the groups that best exemplify these trends are Buhtrap, Ratopak Spider, Cobalt Group and Corkow, Metel.\nThe group discussed in this white paper is part of this new trend. We call this new group RTM; it uses custom malware, written in Delphi, that we cover in detail in later sections. The first trace of this tool in our telemetry data dates back to late 2015. The group also makes use of several different modules that they deploy where appropriate to their targets. They are interested in users of remote banking systems (RBS), mainly in Russia and neighboring countries.\nThat this group is mostly targeting businesses is apparent from the processes they are looking for on a compromised system.

This series of suspected network intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Italy. These organizations have not been publicly reported as targets of Chinese threat activity groups prior to this campaign.\nThese network intrusions occured ahead of the anticipated September 2020 renewal of the landmark 2018 China-Vatican provisional agreement, a deal which reportedly resulted in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gaining more control and oversight over the country’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic community. In addition to the Holy See itself, another likely target of the campaign includes the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China, whose predecessor was considered to have played a vital role in the 2018 agreement.\nThe suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta insight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal’s September 2020 renewal. The targeting of the Hong Kong Study Mission and its Catholic Diocese could also provide a valuable intelligence source for both monitoring the diocese’s relations with the Vatican and its position on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement amidst widespread protests and the recent sweeping Hong Kong national security law.\nWhile there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs of RedDelta and the threat activity group publicly referred to as Mustang Panda, Bronze President (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are a few notable distinctions which lead us to designate this activity as RedDelta:\n• The version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses a different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different configuration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.\n• The malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been publicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.\nIn addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic Church, Insikt Group also identified RedDelta targeting law enforcement and government entities in India and a government organization in Indonesia.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverRedDeltaRecorded FutureTA416Proofpoint\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2020\nObserved Sectors\n\nGovernment\nLaw enforcement\nTelecommunications\nThe Vatican and Catholic Church-related organizations\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAustralia\nCambodia\nChina\nCzech\nEthiopia\nGermany\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIndonesia\nItaly\nMongolia\nMyanmar\nSlovakia\nSpain\nUkraine\nUSA\nVietnam\n\nTools\n\nCobalt Strike\nPlugX\nPoison Ivy\n\nOperations\n\n2020-08: RedDelta Resumes Its Targeting of the Vatican and Hong Kong Catholic Diocese\ngo.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0915.pdf\n2020-09: Following the Chinese National Day holiday in September, Proofpoint researchers observed a resumption of activity by the APT actor TA416.\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta416-goes-ground-and-returns-golang-plugx-malware-loader\n2021-03: Operation “Dianxun”\nOperation Diànxùn: Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting Telecommunication Companies\nwww.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-dianxun-cyberespionage-campaign-targeting-telecommunication-companies/\n2022-02: Most recently on February 28, 2022, TA416 began using a compromised email address of a diplomat from a European NATO country to target a different country’s diplomatic offices.

From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future’s midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and control (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India’s power sector. 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted campaign against India’s critical infrastructure. Other targets identified included 2 Indian seaports.\nUsing a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure detections, domain analysis, and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined that a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers share some common infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with several previously reported Chinese state-sponsored groups, including APT 41 and Tonto Team, HartBeat, Karma Panda.\nDespite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt Group does not currently believe there is enough evidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular campaign to an existing public group and therefore continue to track it as a closely related but distinct activity group, RedEcho.\nAlso see TAG-38.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverRedEchoRecorded Future\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2020\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\nMaritime and Shipbuilding\n\nObserved Countries\n\nIndia\n\nTools\n\nShadowPad Winnti\n\nInformation\n\ngo.recordedfuture.com/redecho-insikt-group-report\ntherecord.media/redecho-group-parks-domains-after-public-exposure/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n660f5bfa-d726-4935-a2be-7efa6ed8a366\nLast Card Change\n2022-04-08"},"RedFoxtrot":{"slug":"RedFoxtrot","filePath":"RedFoxtrot.md","title":"RedFoxtrot","links":["China","Defense","Government","Telecommunications","Afghanistan","India","Kazakhstan","Pakistan","8.t-Dropper","GUNTERS","Icefog","Impacket","PCShare","PlugX","Poison-Ivy","ShadowPad-Winnti"],"tags":[],"content":"RedFoxtrot\nDescription\n(Recorded Future) RedFoxtrot has been active since at least 2014 and predominantly targets government, defense, and telecommunications sectors across Central Asia, India, and Pakistan, aligning with the likely operational remit of Unit 69010.

Rumours say that the threat actor may use the Signal App as a communication channel with the victim. This is not the case. As a matter of fact, the Signal App is just decoy that the Retefe Gang serves to IP addresses who are not geo located in Switzerland and whose user agent does not correspond to an Android device. If the accessing IP address uses an Android user agent and is geographically located in Switzerland, the APK server will serve an Android trojan that the Retefe gang use to commit e-banking fraud.\nThe trojan is an SMS stealer which allows the threat actor to steal text messages sent by the bank to the customer for two factor authentication (2FA) and transaction signing (so called mobile TAN or mTAN). To have the victim install the android trojan, the Retefe gang uses social engineering to convince the victim to either enter his mobile phone number where he then receives an SMS from the threat actor with a link to the Android APK, or to scan a QR code displayed by the threat actor in the fake e-banking portal, which also leads to the Android APK. But the Android trojan is more than just an SMS stealer. It is also able to send text messages to other victim’s and uses a sophisticated anti VM detection technique. Unlike Retefe itself, which doesn’t have any botnet C&amp;C channel, the SMS stealer has such one.

One such popular product in the underground economy is ransomware. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a fee is paid to the criminals. This modus operandi disrupts legitimate businesses, which may become unavailable until the data is restored. A recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid. Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws.

The redirection led to the installation of Trojanized applications named facebook.apk and chrome.apk that contained Android Trojan-Banker. According to our telemetry data, this malware was detected more than 6,000 times, though the reports came from just 150 unique users (from February 9 to April 9, 2018). Of course, this is down to the nature of the malware distribution, but it also suggests a very painful experience for some users, who saw the same malware appear again and again in their network. More than half of the detections were observed targeting the Asian region.\nDuring our research we received some invaluable information about the true scale of this attack. There were thousands of daily connections to the command and control (C2) infrastructure, with the device locale for the majority of victims set to Korean. Since we didn’t find a pre-existing name for this malware operation, we decided to assign a new one for future reference. Based on its propagation via smartphones roaming between Wi-Fi networks, potentially carrying and spreading the infection, we decided to call it ‘Roaming Mantis’.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverRoaming MantisKasperskyRoaming Mantis GroupKasperskyShaoye?\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Countries\n\nAzerbaijan\nBangladesh\nBrazil\nCambodia\nCanada\nChina\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIran\nIreland\nItaly\nJapan\nKazakhstan\nNetherlands\nRussia\nSaudi Arabia\nSouth Korea\nSri Lanka\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nThailand\nTurkey\nUK\nUSA\nVietnam\n\nTools\n\nRoaming Mantis\nSmsSpy\n\nOperations\n\n2018-02: Roaming Mantis malware is designed for distribution through a simple, but very efficient trick based on a technique known as DNS hijacking.

As this activity is similar to some POS utilities, this is likely intended to reduce the network activity footprint of RtPOS and ensure the malware remains undetected for longer, thus earning the controllers a healthier profit. The RtPOS malware is also simplistic in features, largely automated in operation, and lacks many of the features that more mature POS malware families do.\nThe lack of a network exfiltration feature, interaction and user commands, as well as a dropper component hints at more serious implications: in order for RtPOS to execute and in order to retrieve the captured payment card data, the attackers would have existing access to the victim’s machine(s).

Once executed, themalware first attempts to disable the ‘System Event Notification’ and ‘Alerter’ services.\nNote: The Alerter service is present in Windows XP and Windows 2003, which are no longer supported by Microsoft.  Current operating systems supported by Microsoft do not run the Alerter service.\nNext, the malware overwrites the MBR, displaying a status in the command (CMD) window.  If the malware is able to overwrite the MBR, an ‘OK’ status is displayed in the CMD window. If the malware is unable to overwrite the MBR, a ‘Fail’ status is displayed.\nAfter the MBR is overwritten, the malware attempts to gain access to physical and network drives attached to the victim’s system and recursively enumerate through the drive’s contents. When the malware identifies a file, it overwrites the file’s contents with NULL bytes, renames the file with a randomly generated file name, then deletes the file, making forensic recovery impossible.\nIf the malware is able to overwrite, rename and delete the file, the CMD window will display a ‘Break&gt;’ status.  If the malware is only able to delete the file, the CMD window will display a ‘Del&gt;’ status.\nOnce the malware has completed deleting files, the system is rebooted.

For starters, we discovered it being spread via watering hole attacks, a technique that involves an attacker compromising a website before adding code to it so visitors are redirected to the infecting code. In this case, each visitor is redirected only once. The infection was done by exploiting CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript engine vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft back in May 2018.\nSecond, it uses a multi-stage infection scheme. After it exploits the vulnerability, it downloads a DLL and runs it in PowerShell (PS). This file, which is a downloader, then downloads and runs the second executable file containing a backdoor. The first stage downloader also checks for the existence of different kinds of antivirus software processes, and then proceeds to exit if any is found.

Because “noisier” campaigns are becoming increasingly well-known within the security community, new and smaller campaigns are beginning to emerge.\nThis research paper documents the operations of a campaign we refer to as “Safe,” based on the names of the malicious files used. It is an emerging and active targeted threat.\nWhile we have yet to determine the campaign’s total number of victims, it appears that nearly 12,000 unique IP addresses spread over more than 100 countries were connected to two sets of command-and-control (C&amp;C) infrastructures related to Safe. We also discovered that the average number of actual victims remained at 71 per day, with few if any changes from day to day. This indicates that the actual number of victims is far less than the number of unique IP addresses. Due to large concentrations of IP addresses within specific network blocks, it is likely that the number of victims is even smaller and that they have dynamically assigned IP addresses, which have been compromised for some time now.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverSafeTrend Micro\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2013\nObserved Sectors\n\nEducation\nGovernment\nMedia\nNGOs\nTechnology\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAlgeria\nAustralia\nBrazil\nBulgaria\nCanada\nChina\nEgypt\nHungary\nIndia\nMalaysia\nMongolia\nPakistan\nPhilippines\nRomania\nRussia\nSaudi Arabia\nSerbia\nSouth Korea\nSouth Sudan\nSyria\nUAE\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nDebugView\nLZ77\nOpenDoc\nSafe\nTypeConfig\nUPXShell\nUsbDoc\nUsbExe\nan MS Office 0-day exploit\n\nInformation\n\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hiding-in-plain-sight-a-new-apt-campaign/\nwww.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-safe-a-targeted-threat.pdf\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nf0390e00-c32a-40e7-8518-3fcca0dd6e84\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-14"},"SafetyKatz":{"slug":"SafetyKatz","filePath":"SafetyKatz.md","title":"SafetyKatz","links":["Mimikatz"],"tags":[],"content":"SafetyKatz\nDescription\nSafetyKatz is a combination of slightly modified version of @gentilkiwi’s Mimikatz project and @subtee’s .NET PE Loader.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSafetyKatz\nCategory\nTools\nType\n\nCredential stealer\n\nInformation\n\ngithub.com/GhostPack/SafetyKatz\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nd44dcfd7-93d4-4a9c-a68d-c37844d59d4d\nLast Card Change\n2021-11-02"},"Sagerunex":{"slug":"Sagerunex","filePath":"Sagerunex.md","title":"Sagerunex","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Sagerunex\nDescription\n(Symantec) This malware appears to be an evolution of an older Billbug tool known as Evora.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSagerunex\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nsymantec-blogs.broadcom.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/thrip-apt-south-east-asia\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S1210\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sagerunex\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:Sagerunex\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n1a410879-730a-493c-97c0-bfbc514fe1f3\nLast Card Change\n2025-06-28"},"SaintBear,-Lorec53":{"slug":"SaintBear,-Lorec53","filePath":"SaintBear, Lorec53.md","title":"SaintBear, Lorec53","links":["Russia","Energy","Financial","Government","Media","Transportation","Georgia","Ukraine","USA","Cobalt-Strike","Graphiron","GraphSteel","GrimPlant","OutSteel","SaintBot"],"tags":[],"content":"SaintBear, Lorec53\nDescription\n(NSFOCUS) In July 2021, several phishing documents created in Georgian were discovered by NSFOCUS Security Labs.

While there is some overlap between IP addresses used by Scarlet Mimic and Putter Panda, APT 2, it has not been concluded that the groups are the same.\n(Palo Alto) The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary’s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.\nThe attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC.\nScarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities.

At least some UNC3944 threat actors appear to operate in underground communities, such as Telegram and underground forums, which they may leverage to acquire tools, services, and/or other support to augment their operations. This activity overlaps with activity that has been reported in open sources as ‘0ktapus,’ ‘Scatter Swine,’ and ‘Scattered Spider.’ Since 2022 and through early 2023, UNC3944 appeared to focus on accessing credentials or systems used to enable SIM swapping attacks, likely in support of secondary criminal operations occurring outside of victim environments. However, in mid-2023, UNC3944 began to shift to deploying ransomware in victim environments, signaling an expansion in the group’s monetization strategies. These changes in their end goals signal that the industries targeted by UNC3944 will continue to expand; Mandiant has already directly observed their targeting broaden beyond telecommunication and

The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems.\nThe actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverSea TurtleTalosSiliconMicrosoftUNC1326FireEyeMarbled DustMicrosoftTeal KurmaPwCCosmic WolfCrowdStrike\nCountry\n\nTurkey\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nAerospace\nDefense\nEnergy\nGovernment\nNGOs\nTelecommunications\nThink Tanks\nIntelligence agencies\n\nObserved Countries\n\nAlbania\nArmenia\nCyprus\nEgypt\nGreece\nIraq\nJordan\nLebanon\nLibya\nNetherlands\nSudan\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nSyria\nTurkey\nUAE\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nDrupalgeddon\nDNS hijacking\n\nOperations\n\n2018-01: Talos now has moderate confidence that the threat actors behind Sea Turtle have been using another DNS hijacking technique.

In fact, the page is not being displayed at all on the infected system; the Trojan just decodes the information within the comments and is able to understand the commands the attacker is sending. On a cursory look to the actual blog, a visitor would never spot any of this, since the comments are never displayed on the browser either.\nThis is a perfect vehicle for these attackers, who are trying to stay undetected for as long as possible. ShadyRAT was the first major targeted attack that was spotted in the wild, and this technique was possibly a contributing factor.

SinoChopper not only performs host identification and backdoor delivery but also email archive theft and additional activity.

This technique has been already seen recently from other banking trojans, such as Gustuff. ATS (Automatic Transfer System) is an advanced attack technique (fairly new on Android) which enables attackers to auto-fill fields in legitimate mobile banking apps and initiate money transfers from the compromised devices. Contrary to TeaBot and Oscorp/UBEL where a live operator is required to insert and authorize a money transfer, with ATS technique Threat Actors can scale up their operations with minimum user intervention. We assume that SharkBot is trying to bypass behavioural detection countermeasures (e.g.,biometrics) put in place by multiple banks and financial services with the abuse of Android Accessibility Services, also bypassing the need of a “new device enrollment”.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSharkBot\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBanking trojan\nInfo stealer\nCredential stealer\n\nInformation\n\nwww.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/sharkbot-a-new-generation-of-android-trojan-is-targeting-banks-in-europe\nresearch.nccgroup.com/2022/03/03/sharkbot-a-new-generation-android-banking-trojan-being-distributed-on-google-play-store/\nblog.checkpoint.com/2022/04/07/android-banking-stealer-dubbed-sharkbot-found-disguised-as-legitimate-anti-virus-apps-on-the-google-play-store/\nwww.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/android-sharkbot-droppers-on-google-play-underlines-platforms-security-needs/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S1055\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/apk.sharkbot\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nfba647ac-53a5-4801-828c-6f6cc549bc09\nLast Card Change\n2023-06-22"},"Sharp-SMBExec":{"slug":"Sharp-SMBExec","filePath":"Sharp-SMBExec.md","title":"Sharp-SMBExec","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Sharp-SMBExec\nDescription\nA native C# conversion of Kevin Robertsons Invoke-SMBExec powershell script.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSharp-SMBExec\nCategory\nTools\nType\n\nCredential stealer\n\nInformation\n\ngithub.com/checkymander/Sharp-SMBExec\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ndea2e0b6-de7c-4fbf-bba4-994bf4714f36\nLast Card Change\n2022-02-10"},"SharpEfsPotato":{"slug":"SharpEfsPotato","filePath":"SharpEfsPotato.md","title":"SharpEfsPotato","links":["SweetPotato"],"tags":[],"content":"SharpEfsPotato\nDescription\nA local privilege escalation tool using EfsRpc, built from SweetPotato.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSharpEfsPotato\nCategory\nExploits\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\ngithub.com/bugch3ck/SharpEfsPotato\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n273be077-2621-4eb5-b000-ca8372b0ceec\nLast Card Change\n2024-06-19"},"SharpHound":{"slug":"SharpHound","filePath":"SharpHound.md","title":"SharpHound","links":["BloodHound"],"tags":[],"content":"SharpHound\nDescription\nC# Rewrite of the BloodHound Ingestor.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSharpHound\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nReconnaissance\nInfo stealer\n\nInformation\n\ngithub.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound3\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ne6b2dbf6-0cea-40f8-98af-14ab4ad2ae27\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-20"},"SharpJSHandler":{"slug":"SharpJSHandler","filePath":"SharpJSHandler.md","title":"SharpJSHandler","links":["Ps2dllLoader"],"tags":[],"content":"SharpJSHandler\nDescription\n(Bitdefender) One of the payloads carried by Ps2dllLoader is SharpJSHandler.

While referencing a real report published by HRW, the links provided for the Director’s biography and article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spear-phishing attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering tactics and narrow targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical and stylistic errors that would be obvious to a native speaker, the actors demonstrated stronger English­language proficiency than past intrusion sets and a deeper investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors appropriated a real identity that would be expected to professionally interact with the subject, then offered validation through links to their biography and social media, the former of which itself was malware as well. The bait documents contained a real article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the message attempted to address to how it aligned with their professional research or field of employment. The referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing as legitimate files using the common right­to­left filenames tactic in order to conceal the actual file extension.

More specifically, the malware was an account manipulation tool that contained code extracted from both Dumpert and Mimikatz. We called this malware SkeletonKeyInjector. The malware employed a technique that altered the NTLM authentication program and implanted a skeleton key to allow adversaries to log-in without a valid credential. This allowed the adversary to achieve the following objectives:\n● Persistence: After the code in memory was altered, the adversary could gain access to the compromised machines before the next system reboot. As AD machines are rarely rebooted, the adversary was able to control the machines for a very long time.\n● Defense Evasion: Aside from the different login password and login algorithm scheme, there was no difference when compared to a normal login activity. Furthermore, normal users could still log-in to the system via their original password. Thus, the probability of being exposed was low.\n● Lateral Movement: Adversaries could use the skeleton key to login to other machines that were in the same domain.

Germany’s Der Spiegel re-published the slide set with far less deletions recently, in January 2015, and therefore gave a deeper insight about what CSEC actually says they have tracked down.\nThe newly published documents reveal: the so called operation SNOWGLOBE, was discovered in 2009 (slide 9) and consists of three different “implants”, two were dubbed snowballs and one “more sophisticated implant, discovered in mid-2010” is tagged as snowman (slide 7). According to slide 22, “CSEC assesses, with moderate certainty, SNOWGLOBE to be a state-sponsored CNO [Cyber Network Operation] effort, put forth by a French intelligence agency.” The information given dates back to 2011 and nothing else has been published since.

We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year, its association with Sowbug was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier.\nTo date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia.

While ransomware for Linux has existed for many years, BGH actors have historically not targeted Linux, much less ESXi specifically. ESXi is a type of hypervisor that runs on dedicated hardware and manages multiple virtual machines (VMs). With more organizations migrating to virtualization solutions to consolidate legacy IT systems, this is a natural target for ransomware operators looking to increase the impact against a victim.\nAll identified incidents were enabled by the acquisition of valid credentials. In four separate Defray777 incidents, SPRITE SPIDER used administrator credentials to log in through the vCenter web interface. In one instance, SPRITE SPIDER likely used the PyXie remote access trojan (RAT) LaZagne module to harvest vCenter administrator credentials stored in a web browser.\nBy targeting these hosts, ransomware operators are able to quickly encrypt multiple systems with relatively few actual ransomware deployments. Encrypting one ESXi server inflicts the same amount of damage as individually deploying ransomware on each VM hosted on a given server. Consequently, targeting ESXi hosts can also improve the speed of BGH operations. Additionally, due to their lack of conventional operating systems, ESXi hosts lack endpoint protection software that could prevent or detect ransomware attacks.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverSprite SpiderCrowdStrikeGold DupontSecureWorks\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\nFinancial gain\n\nFirst Seen\n2015\nObserved Sectors\n\nEducation\nHealthcare\nManufacturing\nTechnology\n\nTools\n\nCobalt Strike\nDefray777\nLaZagne\nMetasploit\nPyXie\nSharpHound\nShifu\nSystemBC\nVatet\n\nOperations\n\n2017-08: New Defray Ransomware Targets Education and Healthcare Verticals\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-defray-ransomware-targets-education-and-healthcare-verticals\n2020-05: Texas Courts hit by ransomware, network disabled to limit spread\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-courts-hit-by-ransomware-network-disabled-to-limit-spread/\n2020-06: New Ransom X Ransomware used in Texas TxDOT cyberattack\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransom-x-ransomware-used-in-texas-txdot-cyberattack/\n2020-08: Business technology giant Konica Minolta hit by new ransomware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/business-technology-giant-konica-minolta-hit-by-new-ransomware/\n2020-09: SoftServe hit by ransomware, Windows customization tool exploited\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/softserve-hit-by-ransomware-windows-customization-tool-exploited/\n2020-09: Leading U.S. laser developer IPG Photonics hit with ransomware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-us-laser-developer-ipg-photonics-hit-with-ransomware/\n2020-09: Government software provider Tyler Technologies hit by ransomware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/government-software-provider-tyler-technologies-hit-by-ransomware/\n2020-10: Montreal’s STM public transport system hit by ransomware attack\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/montreals-stm-public-transport-system-hit-by-ransomware-attack/\n2020-11: Brazil’s court system under massive RansomExx ransomware attack\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brazils-court-system-under-massive-ransomexx-ransomware-attack/\n2020-11: RansomExx ransomware also encrypts Linux systems\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomexx-ransomware-also-encrypts-linux-systems/\n2020-12: Hackers leak data from Embraer, world’s third-largest airplane maker\nwww.zdnet.com/article/hackers-leak-data-from-embraer-worlds-third-largest-airplane-maker/\n2021-02: French MNH health insurance company hit by RansomExx ransomware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/french-mnh-health-insurance-company-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/\n2021-02: Hypervisor Jackpotting: CARBON SPIDER and SPRITE SPIDER Target ESXi Servers With Ransomware to Maximize Impact\nwww.crowdstrike.com/blog/carbon-spider-sprite-spider-target-esxi-servers-with-ransomware/\n2021-07: Ecuador’s state-run CNT telco hit by RansomEXX ransomware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ecuadors-state-run-cnt-telco-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/\n2021-08: RansomEXX ransomware leaks files stolen from Italian luxury brand Zegna\nsecurityaffairs.co/wordpress/120898/data-breach/ransomexx-ransomware-zegna.html\n2021-08: Computer hardware giant GIGABYTE hit by RansomEXX ransomware\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-hardware-giant-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/\n2021-08: Ransomware hits Lojas Renner, Brazil’s largest clothing store chain\ntherecord.media/ransomware-hits-lojas-renner-brazils-largest-clothing-store-chain/\n2022-03: Ransomware group attacks Scottish mental health charity\ntherecord.media/ransomware-group-attacks-scottish-mental-health-charity/\n2022-10: RansomExx Leaks 52GB of Barcelona Health Centers’ Data\nwww.bankinfosecurity.com/ransomexx-leaks-52-gb-barcelona-health-centers-data-a-20260\n2022-11: RansomExx Upgrades to Rust\nsecurityintelligence.com/posts/ransomexx-upgrades-rust/\n\nInformation\n\nwww.neosecuretendencias2021.com/assets/pdfs/crowdstrike/2021%20Global%20Threat%20Report%20FINAL%20.pdf\nwww.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-dupont\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n20947960-7770-472c-8152-4f88a1f7ea69\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-27"},"SprySOCKS":{"slug":"SprySOCKS","filePath":"SprySOCKS.md","title":"SprySOCKS","links":["Derusbi","RedLeaves"],"tags":[],"content":"SprySOCKS\nDescription\n(Trend Micro) Analysis of the SprySOCKS backdoor reveals some interesting findings.

The attacks have been conducted from 2012 until the present, against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents. We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be from an apparently fictitious organization called “The Right to Fight” contacted Rori Donaghy. Donaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, received a spyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to offer him a position on a human rights panel. Donaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past, and had recently published a series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.\nCircumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government. We traced digital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an activist’s Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been under government control. We also identified other bait content employed by this threat actor. We found 31 public tweets sent by Stealth Falcon, 30 of which were directly targeted at one of 27 victims. Of the 27 targets, 24 were obviously linked to the UAE, based on their profile information (e.g., photos, “UAE” in account name, location), and at least six targets appeared to be operated by people who were arrested, sought for arrest, or convicted in absentia by the UAE government, in relation to their Twitter activity.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverStealth FalconCitizen LabFruityArmorKasperskyProject RavenReuters\nCountry\n\nUAE\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2012\nObserved Sectors\n\nCivil society groups and Emirati journalists, activists and dissidents\n\nObserved Countries\n\nNetherlands\nSaudi Arabia\nThailand\nUAE\nUK\n\nTools\n\nDeadglyph\nStealthFalcon\n0-day exploits\n\nOperations\n\n2014: Ex-NSA operatives reveal how they helped spy on targets for the Arab monarchy — dissidents, rival leaders and journalists.\nwww.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/\n2016-10: Windows zero-day exploit used in targeted attacks by FruityArmor APT\nsecurelist.com/windows-zero-day-exploit-used-in-targeted-attacks-by-fruityarmor-apt/76396/\n2018-10: Zero-day exploit (CVE-2018-8453) used in targeted attacks\nsecurelist.com/cve-2018-8453-used-in-targeted-attacks/88151/\n2018-10: Zero-day in Windows Kernel Transaction Manager (CVE-2018-8611)\nsecurelist.com/zero-day-in-windows-kernel-transaction-manager-cve-2018-8611/89253/\n2019-09: ESET researchers discovered a backdoor linked to malware used by the Stealth Falcon group, an operator of targeted spyware attacks against journalists, activists and dissidents in the Middle East.\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2019/09/09/backdoor-stealth-falcon-group/\n2023: Stealth Falcon preying over Middle Eastern skies with Deadglyph\nwww.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/stealth-falcon-preying-middle-eastern-skies-deadglyph/\n2025-03: Inside Stealth Falcon’s Espionage Campaign Using a Microsoft Zero-Day\nblog.checkpoint.com/research/inside-stealth-falcons-espionage-campaign-using-a-microsoft-zero-day/\n\nInformation\n\ncitizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0038/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n6d2ff349-ad5d-4237-9cb3-3d8891c35fbf\nLast Card Change\n2025-06-28"},"Stealth-Mango":{"slug":"Stealth-Mango","filePath":"Stealth Mango.md","title":"Stealth Mango","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Stealth Mango\nDescription\nStealth Mango is Android malware that has reportedly been used to successfully compromise the mobile devices of government officials, members of the military, medical professionals, and civilians.

Storm-0558’s tooling and reconnaissance activity suggests the actor is technically adept, well resourced, and has an in-depth understanding of many authentication techniques and applications.\nWhile we have discovered some minimal overlaps with other Chinese groups such as Violet Typhoon (APT 31, Judgment Panda, Zirconium), we maintain high confidence that Storm-0558 operates as its own distinct group.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverStorm-0558MicrosoftAntique TyphoonMicrosoft\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2023\nObserved Sectors\n\nGovernment\nMedia\nTelecommunications\nThink Tanks\nindividuals connected to Taiwan and Uyghur geopolitical interests\n\nObserved Countries\n\nUSA\nEurope\n\nTools\n\nChina Chopper\n\nInformation\n\nwww.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/\nwww.wiz.io/blog/storm-0558-compromised-microsoft-key-enables-authentication-of-countless-micr\nmsrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/results-of-major-technical-investigations-for-storm-0558-key-acquisition/\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-breach-led-to-theft-of-60-000-us-state-dept-emails/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n23e2ccea-9daa-415a-a72d-b242bbdb3782\nLast Card Change\n2025-06-28"},"StreamEx":{"slug":"StreamEx","filePath":"StreamEx.md","title":"StreamEx","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"StreamEx\nDescription\n(Cylance) Cylance dubbed this family of malware StreamEx, based upon a common exported function used across all samples ‘stream’, combined with the dropper functionality to append ‘ex’ to the DLL file name.\nThe StreamEx family has the ability to access and modify the user’s file system, modify the registry, create system services, enumerate process and system information, enumerate network resources and drive types, scan for security tools such as firewall products and antivirus products, change browser security settings, and remotely execute commands.

Based on our research, SWEED — which has been operating since at least 2017 — primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access trojans.\nSWEED remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. While these campaigns have featured a myriad of different types of malicious documents, the actor primarily tries to infect its victims with a packed version of Agent Tesla — an information stealer that’s been around since at least 2014. The version of Agent Tesla that SWEED is using differs slightly from what we’ve seen in the past in the way that it is packed, as well as how it infects the system. In this post, we’ll run down each campaign we’re able to connect to SWEED, and talk about some of the actor’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverSweedTalos\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nDefense\nEnergy\nFinancial\nShipping and Logistics\nManufacturing\nHuman Resources\n\nObserved Countries\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nCanada\nChina\nDjibouti\nFrance\nGermany\nHong Kong\nIndia\nItaly\nMonaco\nRussia\nQatar\nSingapore\nSouth Africa\nSouth Korea\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nTurkey\nUAE\nUK\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nAgent Tesla\nFormbook\nLokiBot\nRDP\n\nOperations\n\n2017: Steganography\nOne of the earliest SWEED campaigns Talos identified dates back to 2017. In this attack, the actors placed droppers inside of ZIP archives, and then attached those ZIPs to emails. The attachments usually had file names similar to “Java_Updater.zip” or “P-O of Jun2017.zip”.\n2018-01: In early 2018, we observed that SWEED began leveraging Java-based droppers. Similar to previous campaigns, the JAR was directly attached to emails and used file names such as “Order_2018.jar”. The purpose of the JAR was to obtain information about the infected system and facilitate the download of a packed version of Agent Tesla.\n2018-04: In April 2018, SWEED began making use of a previously disclosed Office exploit. One of the documents featured in these email campaigns was notable because it was a PowerPoint document (PPXS).

In May 5, 2011 the Syrian Computer Society registered SEA’s website (syrian-es.com). Because Syria’s domain registration authority registered the hacker site, some security experts have written that the group was supervised by the Syrian state. SEA claimed on its webpage to be no official entity, but ‘a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria’. As soon as May 27, 2011 SEA had removed text that denied it was an official entity. On the new page, the description of ‘not an official entity’ was removed, only says that it was established by a group of young Syrian enthusiasts to combat the use of the Internet, especially people that use of Facebook in Syria to ‘spread hatred’ and ‘destroy peace’.\nThe Syrian Electronic Army uses spam, website defacement, malware, phishing and denial of service attacks against political opposition groups, Western news agencies, human rights groups and seemingly neutral websites for Syrian conflicts. It also attacked government websites in the Middle East and Europe as well as US defense contractors.

The most recent samples of SystemBC carry code that, instead of acting essentially as a virtual private network via a SOCKS5 proxy, uses the Tor anonymizing network to encrypt and conceal the destination of command and control traffic.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameSystemBCCoroxyDroxiDat\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nTunneling\n\nInformation\n\nnews.sophos.com/en-us/2020/12/16/systembc/\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/systembc-christmas-july-socks5-malware-and-exploit-kits\nwww.intel471.com/blog/cobalt-strike-cybercriminals-trickbot-qbot-hancitor\nwww.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/inside-the-systembc-malware-server\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.systembc\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ndd23b5ad-bb56-45fb-9376-dc12ba4147bb\nLast Card Change\n2024-03-06"},"Systems-integration-and-Real-estate":{"slug":"Systems-integration-and-Real-estate","filePath":"Systems integration and Real estate.md","title":"Systems integration and Real estate","links":["Systems-integration-and-Real-estate"],"tags":[],"content":"Systems integration and Real estate\nA page for the sector Systems integration and Real estate."},"TA2101,-Maze-Team":{"slug":"TA2101,-Maze-Team","filePath":"TA2101, Maze Team.md","title":"TA2101, Maze Team","links":["Unknown","Construction","Education","Energy","Financial","Government","Healthcare","Hospitality","IT","Manufacturing","Media","Non-profit-organizations","Oil-and-gas","Retail","Shipping-and-Logistics","Technology","Telecommunications","Transportation","Real-estate","Canada","Costa-Rica","France","Germany","Italy","South-Korea","Thailand","UK","USA","7-Zip","BokBot","BloodHound","Buran","Cobalt-Strike","Egregor","Maze","Mimikatz","nmap","PsExec","SharpHound","WinSCP"],"tags":[],"content":"TA2101, Maze Team\nDescription\n(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers recently detected campaigns from a relatively new actor, tracked internally as TA2101, targeting German companies and organizations to deliver and install backdoor malware.\nThe actor initiated their campaigns impersonating the Bundeszentralamt fur Steuern, the German Federal Ministry of Finance, with lookalike domains, verbiage, and stolen branding in the emails.\nProofpoint researchers have also observed this actor distributing Maze ransomware, employing similar social engineering techniques to those it uses for Cobalt Strike, while also targeting organizations in Italy and impersonating the Agenzia Delle Entrate, the Italian Revenue Agency.

Public research has noted several Chinese APT groups adopting COVID-19 phishing lures in recent months to carry out espionage campaigns against established and expanding target sets. In March 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed a phishing campaign impersonating the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance on COVID-19 critical preparedness to deliver a new malware family that researchers have dubbed “Sepulcher”. This campaign targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy research organizations, and global organizations dealing with economic affairs.  Additionally, a sender email identified in this campaign has been linked to historic Chinese APT targeting of the international Tibetan community using payloads linked to LuckyCat malware. Subsequently, a phishing campaign from July 2020 targeting Tibetan dissidents was identified delivering the same strain of Sepulcher malware. Operator email accounts identified in this campaign have been publicly linked to historic Chinese APT campaigns targeting the Tibetan community delivering ExileRAT malware. Based on the use of publicly known sender addresses associated with Tibetan dissident targeting and the delivery of Sepulcher malware payloads, Proofpoint researchers have attributed both campaigns to the APT actor TA413, which has previously been documented in association with ExileRAT. The usage of publicly known Tibetan-themed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term realignment of TA413’s targets of interest. While best known for their campaigns against the Tibetan diaspora, this APT group associated with the Chinese state interest prioritized intelligence collection around Western economies reeling from COVID-19 in March 2020 before resuming more conventional targeting later this year.\nAn overlap in infrastructure has been observed with Lucky Cat.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverTA413ProofpointWhite Dev 9PWC\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2019\nObserved Countries\n\nTibet\nEurope\n\nTools\n\nExileRAT\nSepulcher\n\nOperations\n\n2021-01: TA413 Leverages New FriarFox Browser Extension to Target the Gmail Accounts of Global Tibetan Organizations\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta413-leverages-new-friarfox-browser-extension-target-gmail-accounts-global\n2022-05: Chinese-linked threat actors are now actively exploiting a Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability (known as ‘Follina’) to execute malicious code remotely on Windows systems.\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-msdt-zero-day-now-exploited-by-chinese-apt-hackers/\n2022: Chinese State-Sponsored Group TA413 Adopts New Capabilities in Pursuit of Tibetan Targets\nwww.recordedfuture.com/chinese-state-sponsored-group-ta413-adopts-new-capabilities-in-pursuit-of-tibetan-targets\n\nInformation\n\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/chinese-apt-ta413-resumes-targeting-tibet-following-covid-19-themed-economic\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ne32ce320-6a58-4213-9865-1733af93fec8\nLast Card Change\n2022-11-18"},"TA428":{"slug":"TA428","filePath":"TA428.md","title":"TA428","links":["Emissary-Panda,-APT-27,-LuckyMouse,-Bronze-Union","China","Government","industrial-plants,-design-bureaus-and-research-institutes","Afghanistan","Belarus","Mongolia","Russia","Ukraine","East-Asia","8.t-Dropper","Albaniiutas","Cotx-RAT","CoughingDown","PhantomNet","PlugX","Poison-Ivy","TManger"],"tags":[],"content":"TA428\nDescription\n(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers initially identified email campaigns with malicious RTF document attachments targeting East Asian government agencies in March 2019.

Spear phishing emails included malicious .doc attachments that were actually RTF files saved with .doc file extensions.\nThe lures used in the subjects, attachment names, and attachment content in several cases utilized information technology themes specific to Asia such as governmental or public training documents relating to IT. On one specific occasion an email utilized the subject “ITU Asia-Pacific Online CoE Training Course on ‘Conformity &amp; Interoperability in 5G’ for the Asia-Pacific Region, 15-26 April 2019” and the attachment name “190315_annex 1 online_course_agenda_coei_c&amp;i.doc”.

The actor typically targets Central Asian countries, Russia, Belarus, Mongolia, and others. TA549 possesses a diverse malware arsenal including PlugX, NetTraveler, and ZeroT.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverTA459Proofpoint\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nFinancial\nTelecommunications\njournalists\n\nObserved Countries\n\nBelarus\nMongolia\nRussia\nCentral Asia others\n\nTools\n\nGh0st RAT\nNetTraveler\nPlugX\nZeroT\n\nOperations\n\n2022-04: Tracing State-Aligned Activity Targeting Journalists, Media\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/above-fold-and-your-inbox-tracing-state-aligned-activity-targeting-journalists\n\nInformation\n\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/apt-targets-financial-analysts\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0062/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\nda14ab64-16ed-4d61-93a7-69cf3f06115d\nLast Card Change\n2022-07-20"},"TA505,-Graceful-Spider,-Gold-Evergreen":{"slug":"TA505,-Graceful-Spider,-Gold-Evergreen","filePath":"TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen.md","title":"TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen","links":["Avalanche","Narwhal-Spider","Monty-Spider","Mummy-Spider,-TA542","Buhtrap,-Ratopak-Spider","Silence,-Contract-Crew","Indrik-Spider","Doppel-Spider","Dungeon-Spider","FIN11","Russia","Education","Financial","Healthcare","Hospitality","Retail","Worldwide","Amadey","AndroMut","Bart","CryptoLocker","CryptoMix","Dridex","Dudear","EmailStealer","FlawedAmmyy","FlawedGrace","FlowerPippi","GameOver-Zeus","Gelup","Get2","GlobeImposter","Jaff","Kegotip","Locky","MINEBRIDGE","MirrorBlast","Neutrino","Philadelphia","Pony","ReflectiveGnome","RockLoader","RMS","SDBbot","ServHelper","Shifu","Snatch","TeslaGun","TinyMet","Zeus","Living-off-the-Land"],"tags":[],"content":"TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen\nDescription\n(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers track a wide range of threat actors involved in both financially motivated cybercrime and state-sponsored actions. One of the more prolific actors that we track – referred to as TA505 – is responsible for the largest malicious spam campaigns we have ever observed, distributing instances of the Dridex banking Trojan, Locky ransomware, Jaff ransomware, The Trick banking Trojan, and several others in very high volumes.\nBecause TA505 is such a significant part of the email threat landscape, this blog provides a retrospective on the shifting malware, payloads, and campaigns associated with this actor. We examine their use malware such as Jaff, Bart, and Rockloader that appear to be exclusive to this group as well as more widely distributed malware like Dridex and Pony. Where possible, we detail the affiliate models with which they are involved and outline the current state of TA505 campaigns.\nTA505 is arguably one of the most significant financially motivated threat actors because of the extraordinary volumes of messages they send. The variety of malware delivered by the group also demonstrates their deep connections to the underground malware scene. At the time of writing, Locky ransomware remains their malware of choice, even as the group continues to experiment with a variety of additional malware.\nMuch of the malware from TA505 has been observed to be distributed using Avalanche, Cutwail (operated by Narwhal Spider), Necurs (operated by Monty Spider) and Emotet (operated by Mummy Spider, TA542).\nTA505 also has some infrastructure overlap with Buhtrap, Ratopak Spider and Group-IB found several relationships with Silence, Contract Crew.\nThe Dridex development appears to have been done by a subgroup named Indrik Spider and, by extension, Doppel Spider.\nSee also: Dungeon Spider and FIN11.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverTA505ProofpointGraceful SpiderCrowdStrikeGold EvergreenSecureWorksGold TahoeSecureWorksTEMP.WarlockFireEyeATK 103ThalesSectorJ04ThreatReconHive0065IBMChimborazoMicrosoftSpandex TempestMicrosoft\nCountry\n\nRussia\n\nMotivation\n\nFinancial crime\nFinancial gain\n\nFirst Seen\n2006\nObserved Sectors\n\nEducation\nFinancial\nHealthcare\nHospitality\nRetail\n\nObserved Countries\n\nWorldwide\n\nTools\n\nAmadey\nAndroMut\nBart\nCryptoLocker\nCryptoMix\nDridex\nDudear\nEmailStealer\nFlawedAmmyy\nFlawedGrace\nFlowerPippi\nGameOver Zeus\nGelup\nGet2\nGlobeImposter\nJaff\nKegotip\nLocky\nMINEBRIDGE\nMirrorBlast\nNeutrino\nPhiladelphia\nPony\nReflectiveGnome\nRockLoader\nRMS\nSDBbot\nServHelper\nShifu\nSnatch\nTeslaGun\nTinyMet\nZeus\nLiving off the Land\n\nOperations\n\n2017-10: On October 10, TA505 introduced their first geo-targeted campaign dropping either Locky or The Trick banking Trojan.

In April, TA505 targeted Latin American countries Chile and Mexico, and even Italy using either FlawedAmmyy RAT or RMS RAT as payload. By the end of April, we learned that the group started to go after targets in East Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan using FlawedAmmyy RAT as its payload.\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/shifting-tactics-breaking-down-ta505-groups-use-of-html-rats-and-other-techniques-in-latest-campaigns/\n2019-05: During the last month our Threat Intelligence surveillance team spotted increasing evidence of an operation intensification against the Banking sector.\nblog.yoroi.company/research/the-stealthy-email-stealer-in-the-ta505-arsenal/\n2019-05: In the last few days, during monitoring activities, Yoroi CERT noticed a suspicious attack against an Italian organization.

While this activity appeared to be geographically based in Germany, these same techniques could easily be applied to any organization.\nOnce the email attachment was activated, a company’s secure credentials and credit card data could be transmitted covertly to the threat actors. In the 2019 iterations of this attack, TA505 used commercial tools to encrypt all the users files, which suggests this recent activity could also lay the groundwork for an infection vector into the company’s network to encrypt files.\nblog.prevailion.com/2020/03/the-curious-case-of-criminal-curriculum.html\n2020-01: Microsoft says that an ongoing TA505 phishing campaign is using attachments featuring HTML redirectors for delivering malicious Excel documents, this being the first time the threat actors have been seen adopting this technique.\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-new-ta505-malware-attacks-after-short-break/\n2020-04: TA505 Continues to Infect Networks With SDBbot RAT\nsecurityintelligence.com/posts/ta505-continues-to-infect-networks-with-sdbbot-rat/\n2020-06: To evade detection, hackers are requiring targets to complete CAPTCHAs\narstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/06/to-evade-detection-hackers-are-requiring-targets-to-complete-captchas/\n2020-10: Microsoft is warning that cybercriminals have started to incorporate exploit code for the ZeroLogon vulnerability in their attacks.\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-now-using-critical-windows-flaw-in-attacks/\n2021-06: Signed MSI files, Raccoon and Amadey are used for installing ServHelper RAT\nblog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/raccoon-and-amadey-install-servhelper.html\n2021-09: Explosive New MirrorBlast Campaign Targets Financial Companies\nblog.morphisec.com/explosive-new-mirrorblast-campaign-targets-financial-companies\n2021-09: Whatta TA: TA505 Ramps Up Activity, Delivers New FlawedGrace Variant\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/whatta-ta-ta505-ramps-activity-delivers-new-flawedgrace-variant\n2021-10: TA505 exploits SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) for initial access\nresearch.nccgroup.com/2021/11/08/ta505-exploits-solarwinds-serv-u-vulnerability-cve-2021-35211-for-initial-access/\n\nCounter Operations\n\n2010-03: Zeus botnet dealt a blow as ISP Troyak knocked out\nwww.itworld.com/article/2762789/zeus-botnet-dealt-a-blow-as-isp-troyak-knocked-out.html\n2010-10: Operation “Trident Breach”\nFBI announces arrests in $70 million cyber-theft\nedition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/10/01/cyber.theft/\n2012-03: John Doe lawsuit against the Zeus operator\nwww.zeuslegalnotice.com/images/Debenham_Decl_Part_1.pdf\n2014-06: Operation “Tovar”\nDell SecureWorks Contributes to Efforts Targeting Gameover Zeus and CryptoLocker\nwww.secureworks.com/blog/operation-tovar-dell-secureworks-contributes-to-efforts-targeting-gameover-zeus-and-cryptolocker\nwww.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-leads-multi-national-action-against-gameover-zeus-botnet-and-cryptolocker-ransomware\n2016-12: FACT SHEET: Actions in Response to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment\nobamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/29/fact-sheet-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity-and\n2022-11: Suspected Zeus cybercrime ring leader ‘Tank’ arrested by Swiss police\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suspected-zeus-cybercrime-ring-leader-tank-arrested-by-swiss-police/\n\nInformation\n\nwww.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter\nwww.secureworks.com/research/evolution-of-the-gold-evergreen-threat-group\nkrebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/\ne.cyberint.com/hubfs/Report%20Legit%20Remote%20Access%20Tools%20Turn%20Into%20Threat%20Actors%20Tools/CyberInt_Legit%20Remote%20Access%20Tools%20Turn%20Into%20Threat%20Actors’%20Tools_Report.pdf\nwww.cybereason.com/blog/threat-actor-ta505-targets-financial-enterprises-using-lolbins-and-a-new-backdoor-malware\nthreatpost.com/ta505-servhelper-malware/140792/\nblog.prevailion.com/2020/01/ta-505-global-ransomware-criminals.html\npublic.intel471.com/blog/partners-in-crime-north-koreans-and-elite-russian-speaking-cybercriminals/\nblog.fox-it.com/2020/11/16/ta505-a-brief-history-of-their-time/\nblog.fox-it.com/2021/12/02/tracking-a-p2p-network-related-to-ta505/\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n0ac7cc26-cb85-42f7-a2c1-41762b2e2541\nLast Card Change\n2023-04-26"},"TA511":{"slug":"TA511","filePath":"TA511.md","title":"TA511","links":["Unknown","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Germany","Hong-Kong","India","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Kazakhstan","Lithuania","Malaysia","Netherlands","Russia","Singapore","South-Africa","South-Korea","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey","Ukraine","UK","USA","Vietnam","Cobalt-Strike","Ficker-Stealer","Hancitor","NetSupport-Manager"],"tags":[],"content":"TA511\nDescription\n(Palo Alto) Hancitor is an information stealer and malware downloader used by a threat actor designated as MAN1, Moskalvzapoe or TA511.

Notably, this targeting has been geographically concentrated, with the identified SLDCs located in North India, in proximity to the disputed India-China border in Ladakh. One of these SLDCs was also targeted in previous RedEcho activity. This latest set of intrusions, however, is composed of an almost entirely different set of victim organizations. In addition to the targeting of power grid assets, we also identified the compromise of a national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company by the same threat activity group. To achieve this, the group likely compromised and co-opted internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for command and control (C2) of Shadowpad malware infections, as well as use of the open source tool FastReverseProxy (FRP).\nDespite a partial troop disengagement between India and China from February 2021, the prolonged targeting of Indian critical infrastructure continues to raise concerns over pre-positioning activity being conducted by Chinese adversaries. While this latest activity displays targeting and capability consistencies with previously identified RedEcho activity, there are also some notable distinctions. At this time, we have not identified technical evidence allowing us to attribute it to RedEcho, and we are currently clustering this latest activity under the temporary group name Threat Activity Group 38 (TAG-38).\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverTAG-38Recorded Future\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2021\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\n\nObserved Countries\n\nIndia\n\nTools\n\nFRP\nShadowPad Winnti\n\nInformation\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com/continued-targeting-of-indian-power-grid-assets/\ngo.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2022-0406.pdf\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n578b878a-3b29-48ce-8ed0-d6bb0b28a2b0\nLast Card Change\n2022-04-08"},"TAINTEDSCRIBE":{"slug":"TAINTEDSCRIBE","filePath":"TAINTEDSCRIBE.md","title":"TAINTEDSCRIBE","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"TAINTEDSCRIBE\nDescription\n(US-CERT) Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government.

Despite some exceptions, the Taidoor campaign often used Taiwanese IP addresses as C&amp;C servers and email addresses to send out socially engineered emails with malware as attachments. One of the primary targets of the Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese government. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses to send out socially engineered emails in the Chinese language that typically leveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively sent out malicious documents and maintained several IP addresses for command and control.\nAs part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy document to their emails that, when opened, displays the contents of a legitimate document but executes a malicious payload in the background.\nWe were only able to gather a limited amount of information regarding the Taidoor attackers’ activities after they have compromised a target. We did, however, find that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to operate an interactive shell on compromised computers and to upload and download files. In order to determine the operational capabilities of the attackers behind the Taidoor campaign, we monitored a compromised honeypot. The attackers issued out some basic commands in an attempt to map out the extent of the network compromise but quickly realized that the honeypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly disabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This indicated that while Taidoor malware were more widely distributed compared with those tied to other targeted campaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their targets and distinguish these from inadvertently compromised computers and honeypots.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverTaidoorTrend MicroBudminerSymantecEarth AughiskyTrend Micro\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2008\nObserved Sectors\n\nGovernment\n\nObserved Countries\n\nBrazil\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nTaiwan\nUSA\n\nTools\n\nDripion\nTaidoor\n\nOperations\n\n2015 Late: Taiwan targeted with new cyberespionage back door Trojan\ncommunity.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument\n\nInformation\n\nwww.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_the_taidoor_campaign.pdf\nwww.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/connecting-taidoors-dots-earth-aughisky-over-the-last-10-years\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/groups/G0015/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n24403b57-1bb4-4c24-964c-ac2a35e67869\nLast Card Change\n2022-11-18"},"Tailscale":{"slug":"Tailscale","filePath":"Tailscale.md","title":"Tailscale","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tailscale\nDescription\nTailscale connects your team’s devices and development environments for easy access to remote resources.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameTailscale\nCategory\nTools\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\ntailscale.com/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ne6d19f1b-02a0-4b65-a9e2-bb54f0ffe557\nLast Card Change\n2023-11-29"},"Taiwan":{"slug":"Taiwan","filePath":"Taiwan.md","title":"Taiwan","links":["Taiwan"],"tags":[],"content":"Taiwan\nA page for the country Taiwan."},"Tajikistan":{"slug":"Tajikistan","filePath":"Tajikistan.md","title":"Tajikistan","links":["Tajikistan"],"tags":[],"content":"Tajikistan\nA page for the country Tajikistan."},"Tanzania":{"slug":"Tanzania","filePath":"Tanzania.md","title":"Tanzania","links":["Tanzania"],"tags":[],"content":"Tanzania\nA page for the country Tanzania."},"Tapaoux":{"slug":"Tapaoux","filePath":"Tapaoux.md","title":"Tapaoux","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tapaoux\nDescription\n(Kaspersky) Darkhotel campaigns involving typical spear-phished Tapaoux implants publicly appeared in bits and pieces several times over the past five years.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameTapaoux\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nDropper\n\nInformation\n\nmedia.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08070903/darkhotel_kl_07.11.pdf\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.tapaoux\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n9cd4e9ce-f6e7-452c-baa9-c61445b9e259\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-23"},"Tarsip":{"slug":"Tarsip","filePath":"Tarsip.md","title":"Tarsip","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tarsip\nDescription\nThe TARSIP malware family is a backdoor which communicates over encoded information in HTTPS headers.

We identified one specific spear phishing campaign launched against targets within Palestine, and specifically against Palestinian law enforcement agencies. This campaign started in April 2017, using a spear phishing campaign to deliver the MICROPSIA payload in order to remotely control infected systems. Although this technique is not new, it remains an effective technique for attackers.\nThe malware itself was developed in Delphi; in this article, we describe the features and the network communication to the command and control server used by the attackers. The threat actor has chosen to reference TV show characters and include German language words within the attack. Most significantly, the attacker has appeared to have used genuine documents stolen from Palestinian sources as well as a controversial music video as part of the attack.\n(Check Point) While the APT has gone through significant upgrades over the past year, the conductors of these campaigns maintained evident fingerprints, both in the delivery methods and malware development conventions. These unique traces assisted us in correlating the current wave to past attacks, and may also have some resemblance to attacks related to the Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang APT group.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverThe Big BangCheck Point\nCountry\n\nUnknown\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2017\nObserved Sectors\n\nLaw enforcement\nothers\n\nObserved Countries\n\nPalestine\nMiddle East\n\nTools\n\nMicropsia\n\nInformation\n\nblog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/palestine-delphi.html\nresearch.checkpoint.com/2018/apt-attack-middle-east-big-bang/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n28f87cac-ce5e-4c5a-be4c-e0db7a70faef\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-15"},"The-CloudSorcerer":{"slug":"The-CloudSorcerer","filePath":"The CloudSorcerer.md","title":"The CloudSorcerer","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The CloudSorcerer\nDescription\n(Kaspersky) The backdoor module begins by collecting various system information about the victim machine, running in a separate thread.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameThe CloudSorcerer\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nReconnaissance\nBackdoor\nInfo stealer\nDownloader\nLoader\n\nInformation\n\nsecurelist.com/cloudsorcerer-new-apt-cloud-actor/113056/\nsecurelist.com/eastwind-apt-campaign/113345/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n8076eecb-18b5-4122-90f4-ec322cd54b30\nLast Card Change\n2024-08-27"},"The-Vatican-and-Catholic-Church-related-organizations":{"slug":"The-Vatican-and-Catholic-Church-related-organizations","filePath":"The Vatican and Catholic Church-related organizations.md","title":"The Vatican and Catholic Church-related organizations","links":["The-Vatican-and-Catholic-Church-related-organizations"],"tags":[],"content":"The Vatican and Catholic Church-related organizations\nA page for the sector The Vatican and Catholic Church-related organizations."},"The-White-Company":{"slug":"The-White-Company","filePath":"The White Company.md","title":"The White Company","links":["Unknown","Defense","Government","Pakistan"],"tags":[],"content":"The White Company\nDescription\n(Cylance) Cylance has determined that Operation Shaheen was an espionage campaign executed over the course of the last year.

It is of particular interest because several independent experts from countries have voiced the proposition that it is associated with a much more modern — and still active — group, the authors of the Turla APT attack.\nwww.kaspersky.com/blog/moonlight-maze-the-lessons/6713/\n2008-11: Breach of the US Department of Defense\nwww.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/technology/26cyber.html\nThe investigation was called “Operation Buckshot Yankee” and led to the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command.\n2013: Operation “Epic Turla”\nOver the last 10 months, Kaspersky Lab researchers have analyzed a massive cyber-espionage operation which we call “Epic Turla”. The attackers behind Epic Turla have infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries, including government institutions, embassies, military, education, research and pharmaceutical companies.\nsecurelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/\n2014: Breach of the Swiss military firm RUAG\nwww.melani.admin.ch/melani/en/home/dokumentation/reports/technical-reports/technical-report_apt_case_ruag.html\n2014-12: Operation “Penguin Turla”\nThe Turla APT campaigns have a broader reach than initially anticipated after the recent discovery of two modules built to infect servers running Linux. Until now, every Turla sample in captivity was designed for either 32- or 64-bit Windows systems, but researchers at Kaspersky Lab have discovered otherwise.\nthreatpost.com/linux-modules-connected-to-turla-apt-discovered/109765/\n2015: Operation “Satellite Turla”\nObviously, such incredibly apparent and large-scale attacks have little chance of surviving for long periods of time, which is one of the key requirements for running an APT operation. It is therefore not very feasible to perform the attack through MitM traffic hijacking, unless the attackers have direct control over some high-traffic network points, such as backbone routers or fiber optics. There are signs that such attacks are becoming more common, but there is a much simpler way to hijack satellite-based Internet traffic.\nsecurelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/\n2015: Operation “WITCHCOVEN”\nWhen an unsuspecting user visits any of the over 100 compromised websites, a small piece of inserted code—embedded in the site’s HTML and invisible to casual visitors—quietly redirects the user’s browser to a second compromised website without the user’s knowledge. This second website hosts the WITCHCOVEN script, which uses profiling techniques to collect technical information on the user’s computer. As of early November 2015, we identified a total of 14 websites hosting the WITCHCOVEN profiling script.\nwww2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-witchcoven.pdf\n2015: ESET researchers found a previously undocumented backdoor and document stealer. Dubbed Crutch by its developers, we were able to attribute it to the infamous Turla APT group. According to our research, it was used from 2015 to, at least, early 2020.\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/\n2016-11: Operation “Skipper Turla”\nOn 28 January 2017, John Lambert of Microsoft (@JohnLaTwC) tweeted about a malicious document that dropped a “very interesting .JS backdoor“. Since the end of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab has observed Turla using this new JavaScript payload and specific macro variant.\nsecurelist.com/kopiluwak-a-new-javascript-payload-from-turla/77429/\nsecurelist.com/introducing-whitebear/81638/\n2017: Operation “Turla Mosquito”\nESET researchers have observed a significant change in the campaign of the infamous espionage group\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/\n2017-03: New versions of Carbon\nThe Turla espionage group has been targeting various institutions for many years.

A good example is provided by Turla’s watering hole campaigns. Turla, which has been targeting governments, government officials and diplomats for years – see, as an example, this recent paper – is still using watering hole techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&amp;C infrastructure. In fact, they have been using them since at least 2014 with very few variations in their modus operandi.\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/\n2017-07: Russian malware link hid in a comment on Britney Spears’ Instagram\nThe Slovak IT security company ESET Security released a report yesterday detailing a cleverly hidden example of such a post. And its hideout? A Britney Spears photo. Among the nearly 7,000 comments written on the performer’s post (shown below) was one that could easily pass as spam.\nwww.engadget.com/2017/06/07/russian-malware-hidden-britney-spears-instagram/\n2017-08: New backdoor Gazer\nwww.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eset-gazer.pdf\n2017-08: In this case, the dropper is being delivered with a benign and possibly stolen decoy document inviting recipients to a G20 task force meeting on the “Digital Economy”.

Also interesting was Mosquito’s changing delivery techniques, customized PoshSec-Mod open-source powershell use, and borrowed injector code. We tied some of this activity together with infrastructure and data points from WhiteBear and Mosquito infrastructure and activity in 2017 and 2018.\nsecurelist.com/shedding-skin-turlas-fresh-faces/88069/\n2019 Early: 2019 has seen the Turla actor actively renew its arsenal. Its developers are still using a familiar coding style, but they’re creating new tools. Here we’ll tell you about several of them, namely “Topinambour” (aka Sunchoke – the Jerusalem artichoke) and its related modules. We didn’t choose to name it after a vegetable; the .NET malware developers named it Topinambour themselves.\nsecurelist.com/turla-renews-its-arsenal-with-topinambour/91687/\n2019-04: COMpfun successor Reductor infects files on the fly to compromise TLS traffic\nsecurelist.com/compfun-successor-reductor/93633/\n2019-05: Turla, also known as Snake, is an infamous espionage group recognized for its complex malware. To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk.\nwww.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/29/turla-powershell-usage/\n2019: Turla accessed and used the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure of Iranian APTs to deploy their own tools to victims of interest.

In March 2023, we provided details surrounding a custom malware ecosystem utilized on affected Fortinet devices. Furthermore, the investigation uncovered the compromise of VMware technologies, which facilitated access to guest virtual machines.\nInvestigations into more recent operations in 2023 following fixes from the vendors involved in the investigation have corroborated Mandiant’s initial observations that the actor operates in a sophisticated, cautious, and evasive nature.

After analyzing and investigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to the groups and their operation. The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely hamstring the groups’ operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of potential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year. Note –most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose.\nBelow are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted:\n• Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym (“The people whose lips are stitched and sealed” –translation from Persian) –In this channel attack tools attributed to the group ‘OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene’ were leaked; including a webshell that was inserted into the Technion, various tools that were used for DNS attacks, and more.\n• Green Leakers–In this channel attack tools attributed to the group ‘MuddyWater, Seedworm, TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten’ were leaked. The group’s name and its symbol are identified with the “green movement”, which led the protests in Iran after the Presidential elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)\n• Black Box–Unlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long time. On Friday May 5th, dozens of confidential documents labeled as “secret” (a high confidentiality level in Iran, one before the highest –top secret) were posted on this channel. The documents were related to Iranian attack groups’ activity.

The program also stops processes that could be locking important files, such as Microsoft Exchange and SQL Server. Files are encrypted with a combination of AES-256 in ECB mode and RSA-2048. In our initial report published at the time we noted two peculiarities with this program’s implementation:\n• The ransomware uses Mersenne Twister as a source of randomness, but unfortunately for the victims the RNG is reseeded every time new data is consumed. Still, this is unorthodox cryptography, as is the decision to use the “electronic codebook” (ECB) mode for the AES algorithm. The combination of ECB and AES is not semantically secure, which means the patterns of the original clear data are preserved upon encryption. This was reiterated by cybersecurity researchers who analyzed Zoom security in April 2020.\n• VHD implements a mechanism to resume operations if the encryption process is interrupted. For files larger than 16MB, the ransomware stores the current cryptographic materials on the hard drive, in clear text. This information is not deleted securely afterwards, which implies there may be a chance to recover some of the files.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameVHDVHD Ransomware\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nRansomware\nBig Game Hunting\n\nInformation\n\nsecurelist.com/lazarus-on-the-hunt-for-big-game/97757/\nid-ransomware.blogspot.com/2020/03/vhd-ransomware.html\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.vhd_ransomware\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:VHD\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n151136f7-8f9b-47de-8edc-b2e38a63bde0\nLast Card Change\n2022-12-28"},"VIDAR":{"slug":"VIDAR","filePath":"VIDAR.md","title":"VIDAR","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"VIDAR\nDescription\nVidar is a forked malware based on Arkei.

This research shows that Valak is more than just a loader for other malware, and can also be used independently as an information stealer to target individuals and enterprises.\nTargeting Enterprises: More recent versions of Valak target Microsoft Exchange servers to steal enterprise mailing information and passwords along with the enterprise certificate. This has the potential to access critical enterprise accounts, causing damage to organizations, brand degradation, and ultimately a loss of consumer trust.\nTargets US and Germany: This campaign is specifically targeting enterprises in the US and Germany.\nWith a Rich Modular Architecture: Valak’s basic capabilities are extended with a number of plugin components for reconnaissance and information stealing.\nUsing Fast Development Cycles: Valak has evolved from a loader to a sophisticated, multi-stage modular malware that collects plugins from its C2 server to expand its capabilities. The Cybereason Nocturnus team has observed over 30 different versions in about 6 months.\nDesigned for Stealth: Valak is a stealthy malware that uses advanced evasive techniques like ADS and hiding components in the registry.

In weekly publications, the dumps were said to come from Vault 7 and later Vault 8, until his arrest in 2018.\nMost of the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective vendors, but many have been used by other threat actors.\nThis actor turned out to be a former CIA software engineer.\n(WikiLeaks) Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named “Vault 7” by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.\nThe first full part of the series, “Year Zero”, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.\nRecently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, Trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA.

In this campaign, the affected organizations span the communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology, and education sectors. Observed behavior suggests that the threat actor intends to perform espionage and maintain access without being detected for as long as possible. Microsoft is choosing to highlight this Volt Typhoon activity at this time because of our significant concern around the potential for further impact to our customers.

Although the file is empty, the file name contains the hostname of the compromised computer, followed by its MAC address, along with the campaign code the attackers use to identify which malware attack caused the compromise:\n~[HOSTNAME][MAC_ADDRESS][CAMPAIGN_CODE]\nThe attacker then creates a file with a name that ends in @.c, which contains a command.\n[HOSTNAME][MAC_ADDRESS][CAMPAIGN_CODE]@.c\nThe compromised computer then downloads the file and executes the specified command, which may include any of the following:\n• Get external IP address\n• Execute shell command\n• Download file\n• Upload file\nThe compromised computer then sends the output to the C&amp;C server and deletes the command file.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameWMI GhostWimmieSyndicasec\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nwww.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_luckycat_redux.pdf\nsecrary.com/ReversingMalware/WMIGhost/\nwww.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/thrip-hits-satellite-telecoms-defense-targets\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.wmighost\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n79ca754c-8547-4c75-b7c9-836e9bf0034f\nLast Card Change\n2020-05-14"},"WSCSPL":{"slug":"WSCSPL","filePath":"WSCSPL.md","title":"WSCSPL","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"WSCSPL\nDescription\n(Qihoo 360) A decoy document captured by QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center is called ‘SOP for Retrieval of Mobile Data Records.

After further investigation, Dragos observed WASSONITE tools and behaviors targeting multiple industrial control system (ICS) entities including electric generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and organizations involved in space-centric research. WASSONITE has been active since at least 2018.\nWASSONITE targeting focuses on Asian entities, largely in India, as well as possibly Japan and South Korea. At this time, WASSONITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific disruptive or destructive capability. All the activity represents Stage 1 ICS kill-chain: access operations within IT networks.\nWASSONITE operations rely on deploying DTrack malware for remote access to victim machines, capturing credentials via Mimikatz and publicly available tools, and utilizing system tools to transfer files and move laterally within the enterprise system. Researchers first disclosed DTrack in late September 2019, and identified the tool targeting Indian financial institutions and research centers. DTrack is loosely connected to an earlier observed malware family, ATMDTrack, used for robbing ATM machines.\nThird-party security firms associate DTrack and its related malware to the Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima. Dragos also associates the activity group Covellite to Lazarus Group. However, while COVELLITE is also linked to broader Lazarus activity, this group leveraged substantially different capabilities and infrastructure to pursue a target set that does not overlap with observed WASSONITE activity.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverWassoniteDragos\nCountry\n\nNorth Korea\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2018\nObserved Sectors\n\nEnergy\nOil and gas\nManufacturing\nResearch\n\nObserved Countries\n\nIndia\nJapan\nSouth Korea\n\nTools\n\nDtrack\nMimikatz\n\nOperations\n\n2019-10: Breach of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant\nwww.zdnet.com/article/confirmed-north-korean-malware-found-on-indian-nuclear-plants-network/\n\nInformation\n\ndragos.com/resource/wassonite/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n7ff50a06-a05b-4871-b2d5-1a49dcab389b\nLast Card Change\n2020-04-15"},"WastedLoader":{"slug":"WastedLoader","filePath":"WastedLoader.md","title":"WastedLoader","links":["WastedLocker"],"tags":[],"content":"WastedLoader\nDescription\n(Bitdefender) The delivered malware looks like a new variant of WastedLocker, but this new sample is missing the ransomware part, which is probably downloaded from the C&amp;C servers.

The ransomware name is derived from the filename it creates which includes an abbreviation of the victim’s name and the string ‘wasted’. The abbreviation of the victim’s name was also seen in BitPaymer, although a larger portion of the organisation name was used in BitPaymer and individual letters were sometimes replaced by similar looking numbers.\nTechnically, WastedLocker does not have much in common with BitPaymer, apart from the fact that it appears that victim specific elements are added using a specific builder rather than at compile time, which is similar to BitPaymer. Some similarities were also noted in the ransom note generated by the two pieces of malware. The first WastedLocker example we found contained the victim name as in BitPaymer ransom notes and also included both a protonmail.com and tutanota.com email address. Later versions also contained other Protonmail and Tutanota email domains, as well as Eclipso and Airmail email addresses.

It has attacked multi-billion dollar companies operating in the internet, IT software, pharmaceutical, and commodities sectors. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who have publicly acknowledged attacks.\nButterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before moving on to its next target.\nThis group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead focused on high-level corporate information.

The group has heavily targeted the gaming industry, but it has also expanded the scope of its targeting. Some reporting suggests a number of other groups, including APT 41, Axiom, Group 72, APT 17, Deputy Dog, Elderwood, Sneaky Panda, and Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon, are closely linked to or overlap with Winnti Group.\n(Trend Micro) The group behind the Winnti malware (which we will call the Winnti group for brevity) sprung up as a band of traditional cyber crooks, comprising black hats whose technical skills were employed to perpetrate financial fraud. Based on the use of domain names they registered, the group started out in the business of fake/rogue anti-virus products in 2007. In 2009, the Winnti group shifted to targeting gaming companies in South Korea using a self-named data- and file-stealing malware.\nThe group, which was primarily motivated by profit, is noted for utilizing self-developed technically-proficient tools for their attacks. They once attacked a game server to illicitly farm in-game currency (“gaming gold”, which also has real-world value) and stole source codes of online game projects. The group also engaged in the theft of digital certificates which they then used to sign their malware to make them stealthier. The Winnti group diversified its targets to include enterprises such as those in pharmaceutics and telecommunications. The group has since earned infamy for being involved in malicious activities associated with targeted attacks, such as deploying spear-phishing campaigns and building a backdoor.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverWinnti GroupKasperskyWicked PandaCrowdStrikeLeopard TyphoonMicrosoft\nCountry\n\nChina\n\nSponsor\nState-sponsored\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2010\nObserved Sectors\n\nOnline video game companies\nAviation\nDefense\nEducation\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nPharmaceutical\nTechnology\nTelecommunications\n\nObserved Countries\n\nBelarus\nBrazil\nChina\nGermany\nIndia\nIndonesia\nJapan\nPeru\nPhilippines\nRussia\nSouth Korea\nTaiwan\nThailand\nUSA\nVietnam\n\nTools\n\nCobalt Strike\nFunnySwitch\nWinnti\n\nOperations\n\n2010: HBGary investigated an information security incident at an American video game company.\n2011: In the autumn of 2011, a Trojan was detected on a huge number of computers – all of them linked by the fact that they were used by players of a popular online game. It emerged that the piece of malware landed on users’ computers as part of a regular update from the game’s official update server. Some even suspected that the publisher itself was spying on players.

It turns out that the target functionality is implemented in different files. Each file provides a specific remote control feature and is downloaded from the attackers’ server every time the system starts up. These files are not saved on disk or in the registry but are loaded directly into the memory.\nAt the very start of the operation, after launching the driver, PlusDLL collects information about the infected system. A unique identifier for the infected computer is generated based on information about the hard drive and the network adapter’s MAC address, e.g., TKVFP-XZTTL-KXFWH-RBJLF-FXWJR. The attackers are interested primarily in the computer’s name, the program which loaded the malicious library, as well as information about remote desktop sessions (session name, client name, user name and session time). All of this data is collected in a buffer, which is then compressed and sent to the attackers’ control center.\nIn reply to this initial message from the bot, the control center sends the list of available plugins. Plugins are DLL libraries that provide specific remote control functions. Upon receiving the list of plugins, the bot downloads them, allocates them in the memory and passes control to these libraries.\nAlso see HighNoon, which seems to be a variant of Winnti.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameWinntiBleDoorRbDoorRibDoor\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nReconnaissance\nRootkit\nBackdoor\nDownloader\nTunneling\nInfo stealer\nExfiltration\n\nInformation\n\nmedia.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf\nwww.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Winnti.pdf\ngithub.com/TKCERT/winnti-suricata-lua\ngithub.com/TKCERT/winnti-nmap-script\ngithub.com/TKCERT/winnti-detector\nwww.protectwise.com/blog/winnti-evolution-going-open-source.html\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/winnti-abuses-github/\nblog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pigs-malware-examining-possible-member-winnti-group/\nsecurelist.com/games-are-over/70991/\nwww.novetta.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/novetta_winntianalysis.pdf\nblogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/decade-of-the-rats\n\nMitre Attack\n\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0141/\n\nMalpedia\n\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.winnti\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/osx.winnti\nmalpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.winnti\n\nAlienvault Otx\n\notx.alienvault.com/browse/pulses:winnti\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n9b25ce20-0707-4676-9b8e-b60a7d794bed\nLast Card Change\n2020-05-14"},"WinorDLL64":{"slug":"WinorDLL64","filePath":"WinorDLL64.md","title":"WinorDLL64","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"WinorDLL64\nDescription\n(ESET) WinorDLL64 serves as a backdoor that most notably acquires extensive system information, provides means for file manipulation, and executes additional commands.

Subsequently, Lab52 shared additional analysis several months later, identifying new activity associated with Winter Vivern.\nThe group has avoided public disclosure since then, until recent attacks targeting Ukraine. A part of a Winter Vivern campaign was reported in recent weeks by the Polish CBZC, and then the Ukraine CERT as UAC-0114. In this activity, CERT-UA and the CBZC collaborated on the release of private technical details which assisted in our research to identify a wider set of activity on the threat actor, in addition to new victims and previously unknown specific technical details. Overall, we find that the Winter Vivern APT is a resource-limited but highly creative group that shows restraint in the scope of their attacks.

It has attracted very little public attention, with the exception of an advisory from the Belarusian CERT in February 2020. In the interim, the group compromised many government agencies and private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\nIn this paper, we present our analysis of this nine-year-long espionage campaign, active since 2011, but which apparently went dark in February 2020.\nWith its primary purpose seemingly being cyber espionage, this group stole documents and other sensitive files, such as victims’ mailboxes. These outcomes were achieved through the use of the XDSpy malware ecosystem, composed of at least seven components: XDDown, XDRecon, XDList, XDMonitor, XDUpload, XDLoc and XDPass.

What is surprising is that the paths are directly hard coded in the samples and not retrieved dynamically by a request to the C&amp;C server.

It has some functions borrowed from Zeus 2.0.8.9 (e.g. the versioning, nrv2b, binstorage-labels), but more importantly, it downloaded a Zeus-like banking trojan (→ Zeus OpenSSL). Furthermore, the loader shared its versioning with the Zeus OpenSSL it downloaded.\nThe initial samples from May 2016 were small (17920 bytes). At some point, visualEncrypt/Decrypt was added, e.g. in v1.11.0.0 (September 2016) with size 27648 bytes. In January 2017 with v1.15.0.0, obfuscation was added, which blew the size up to roughly 80k, and the loader became known as Zloader aka Terdot.

Zingdoor is packed using UPX and heavily obfuscated by a custom obfuscator engine.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameZingdoor\nCategory\nMalware\nType\n\nBackdoor\n\nInformation\n\nwww.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/h/earth-estries-targets-government-tech-for-cyberespionage.html\nwww.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/k/breaking-down-earth-estries-persistent-ttps-in-prolonged-cyber-o.html\n\nOther Information\nUuid\ne67dd84e-f8cc-4d6e-8af0-e212c2c3cc38\nLast Card Change\n2024-12-26"},"ZitMo":{"slug":"ZitMo","filePath":"ZitMo.md","title":"ZitMo","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"ZitMo\nDescription\n(Kaspersky) The first version of ZeuS-in-the-Mobile (ZitMo), malware which targets mTANs, was discovered in the end of September 2010. In that case it was targeting Symbian smartphones. Later on, ZitMo versions for Windows Mobile and Blackberry were found. It comes as no surprise that cybercriminals have created new and sophisticated pieces of mobile malware for Symbian and Windows Mobile; more surprising is that Blackberry devices were also targeted; and even more surprising is that until July 2011 there was no evidence of ZitMo for Android’s existence. And now please ‘welcome’ ZeuS-in-the-Mobile for Android.\nThe first fact that must be mentioned is that ZitMo for Android differs from Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry versions a lot. The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry is the same: C&amp;C cell phone number, SMS commands, and the ability to forward SMS messages from a particular number, as well as the ability to change C&amp;C.\nThe functionality and logic of ZitMo for Android is far more primitive.

In addition, njRAT is still a malware family that is being actively distributed via various methods such as spear-phishing, malvertising, exploit kits and other techniques. Figure 1 shows a screenshot for the njRAT Panel Menu.\nDepending on the configuration taken from the attackers in njRAT panel, the features it provided can be used to perform malicious activities such as stealing sensitive data/information, disabling security software, install additional malicious payload to the victim’s computer and many more harmful actions. Upon the execution of njRAT, it will connect to the command and control (C&amp;C) server, allowing the attacker to perform malicious activity on the victim’s machine.\nOther than that, it will create copies of itself in the %Temp% folder and rename itself by masquerading as a legitimate binary.

Furthermore, it tries to hide its persistence from the user by setting the file attributes as ‘Hidden’ onto the original and the copy of the binary.\nMoreover, it will also make a copy of itself in the “%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu” folder and create or modify the registry key for persistence to ensure it will be executed on startup.

We were able to collect several variations of these tools including one dating back to July 2018.\nThe developer of the collected tools used character names from the anime series Hunter x Hunter, which is the basis for the campaign name “xHunt.” The names of the tools collected include backdoor tools Sakabota, Hisoka, Netero and Killua. These tools not only use HTTP for their command and control (C2) channels, but certain variants of these tools use DNS tunneling or emails to communicate with their C2 as well. While DNS tunneling as a C2 channel is fairly common, the specific method in which this group used email to facilitate C2 communications has not been observed by Unit 42 in quite some time. This method uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) and stolen credentials to create email “drafts” to communicate between the actor and the tool. In addition to the aforementioned backdoor tools, we also observed tools referred to as Gon and EYE, which provide the backdoor access and the ability to carry out post-exploitation activities.\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameName-GiverxHuntPalo AltoSectorD01ThreatReconHive0081IBMCobalt KatanaSecureWorksHunter SerpensPalo Alto\nCountry\n\nIran\n\nMotivation\n\nInformation theft and espionage\n\nFirst Seen\n2018\nObserved Sectors\n\nShipping and Logistics\n\nObserved Countries\n\nKuwait\n\nTools\n\nBumbleBee\nCASHY200\nGon\nEYE\nHisoka\nKillua\nNetero\nSakabota\nSnugy\nTriFive\n\nOperations\n\n2018-05: On May 1 and June 3, 2018, we first saw executables that installed and executed CASHY200 PowerShell scripts\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/more-xhunt-new-powershell-backdoor-blocked-through-dns-tunnel-detection/\n2019-08: Newly Discovered Backdoors Using Deleted Email Drafts and DNS Tunneling for Command and Control\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-backdoors/\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/bumblebee-webshell-xhunt-campaign/\n\nInformation\n\nunit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-attacks-on-kuwait-shipping-and-transportation-organizations/\n\nPlaybook\n\npan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/\n\nOther Information\nUuid\n3a8ec920-4dfd-4a06-81e7-7be8ee639b73\nLast Card Change\n2024-03-10"},"xPack":{"slug":"xPack","filePath":"xPack.md","title":"xPack","links":["EternalBlue"],"tags":[],"content":"xPack\nDescription\n(Symantec) The backdoor allowed the attackers to run WMI commands remotely, while there is also evidence that they leveraged EternalBlue exploits in the backdoor.
